\begin_layout Title
Camera Trap Study on Farm Woltemade, Namibia: Did an increase in leopard
 numbers coincide with a decrease in cheetah numbers?
\end_layout

Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
In addition to prey and habitat preferences, interaction with other predators
 is the third ecological aspect of predator behaviour that can determine
 management options for farmers.
 Especially for cheetahs, competition with larger predators is one of the
 main reasons why conserved areas are insufficient to ensure their long-term
 survival.
 A number of Namibian farmers have reported an increase in leopard numbers
 and a simultaneous decrease in cheetah numbers (pers.
 comm.
 Francois Kok, Rolf Ritter and others).
 The reported increase in leopards could be causing a decline in cheetah
 as the result of direct lethal confrontation between leopards and cheetahs,
 cheetahs avoiding areas with high leopard density ("fear and loathing"
 sensu

), habitat changes more favourable to leopards, changes in available prey
 species, a disproportionate number of cheetahs killed by farmers compared
 to leopards, or other currently unknown reasons.
 However, no such change has been reported on the land of the Cheetah Conservati
on Fund (CCF), where no predators are killed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Woltemade Guest and Hunting Farm is situated in North Central Namibia, about
 40km Northwest of Hochfeld 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 It is a guest and hunting farm as well as a working cattle farm of about
 22 000 ha with its own butchery in total and forms part of the Sandveld
 conservancy.
 The farm falls within the Thornbush shrubland vegetation type of Namibia,
 growing on chromic Cambisols in the southern part, petric Calcisols in
 the centre and ferric Arenosols soil types in the northern part of the
 farm.
 In 2008 CCF did a three month camera trap survey on the land, primarily
 to determine cheetah numbers.
 A total of 3890 pictures were taken, of which 19% where cheetahs, allowing
 for the identification of six different cheetahs

.
 Other predators, including leopard, were also recorded.
 Two cameras were used per site and cameras were placed at 10 play trees
 and next to one road.
 This data presents us with an opportunity to test whether the perceived
 increase in leopard numbers really coincided with a decrease in cheetah
 numbers.

Aims and objectives 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The main aim of the camera trap study is simply to determine if there has
 really been an increase in leopard numbers on the farm Woltemade and secondly,
 if such an increase coincided with a decrease in cheetah numbers.
 If such a change in numbers has indeed occurred, it would suggest that
 more research into the reasons for this change needs to be done to ensure
 the future survival of cheetahs on farmlands.
 Some circumstantial data will also be collected to suggest possible avenues
 of future research.
 There are a number of alternative hypotheses to be tested.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The null hypothesis (H0) is simply that there has been no significant change
 in either leopard or cheetah numbers.
 The perceived change that was reported might be simply because of an increase
 in livestock losses from leopard depredation, leading to farmers thinking
 that there has been an increase in leopard numbers.
 Increasing livestock losses from leopards might be caused by them switching
 to livestock as prey because of changes in wild prey availability, changes
 in farm management bringing more vulnerable livestock into contact with
 areas of high leopard density, or any number of other reasons that does
 not entail an increase in numbers.
 Because of the rise of conservancies, it is also possible that predators
 are less persecuted than before, changing their behaviour, and so they
 are simply seen more easily by farmers.
 Of course, since this study can only be done on the one farm for which
 historical data are available, it is also possible that the sample sizes
 might be too small to show significance (only four cheetah individuals
 identified during previous survey), even if there was a real change in
 numbers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
H1 There might be an actual increase in leopard numbers, but no change in
 cheetah numbers.
 This will indicate that a number of possible reasons could cause an increase
 in leopard numbers, but that these factors donâ€™t really influence the numbers
 of cheetahs and also that leopards are unlikely to influence cheetah numbers
 through direct competition or outright killing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
H2 There might both be an increase in the numbers of leopards and a simultaneous
 decrease in the numbers of cheetahs.
 While this will not indicate any reason for the changes in numbers, it
 would suggest that is possible that leopards can have a direct effect on
 the numbers of cheetahs and that this should be investigated further.
 Finding the reason for the changes will be important, both to ensure the
 long-term survival of the cheetah and for farmers to adapt their management
 practices to take into account the difference in behaviour and predation
 risk between leopards and cheetahs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
H3 There might be an increase in both leopard and cheetah numbers.
 This will indicate that circumstances have somehow changed (e.g.
 a change in habitat, number of available prey species or management changes)
 so that both predator species benefit.
 It might mean that farmers should consider additional management practices
 to protect their livestock from both predator species, but that the current
 management of Woltemade farm and neighbouring conservancy members are benefitin
g predator conservation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
H4 The last, very unlikely result, might be that there has actually been
 an increase in cheetah numbers, while leopard numbers decreased or stayed
 the same.
 This will be the opposite of what is being reported by most farmers and
 will also need more research to find the reason for such a change.

Methods & materials 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 On 12-13 March 2014, camera traps will be set at the exact same 11 sites
 and in the same season of the year as the previous survey.
 Personnel used: Chavoux Luyt, Matti Nghikembua and one intern.
 Materials needed: 1.
 24 Camera traps (provided by CCF) (2 for back-up) 2.
 22 metal poles (provided by R.
 Ritter) 3.
 Spade, hoe and panga for clearing grass and shrubs in front of cameras
 (CCF) 4.
 GPS for finding playtree sites (CCF) 5.
 Vehicle and fuel for transporting equipment (CCF) 6.
 Tents, food and cooking equipment for one night (CCF) 7.
 Cybertracker device with GPS to record camera trap details (C.
 Luyt) 2.
 In order to check the cameras regularly and to save on travelling costs,
 I propose to return to the farm on Tuesday 18 March.
 Data on rainfall, game numbers, and changes in management practices, both
 on his own farm and the neighbouring conservancy members will be collected
 from Rolf Ritter in order to shed more light on the results of the camera
 trap survey.
 Materials needed: 1.
 Tent, food & cooking equipment for at least one week (provided by C.
 Luyt) 2.
 Vehicle and fuel for camera checking (C.
 Luyt) 3.
 Cybertracker device to record camera checking data (C.
 Luyt) 4.
 Charger for batteries (CCF) 5.
 Laptop and back-up external hard-drives for downloading data (pictures
 and Cybertracker) (C.
 Luyt) 6.
 Back-up non-rechargeable batteries (C.
 Luyt) 3.
 During the stay on the farm, I will also work on various other aspects
 of the PhD: 1.
 Finish up first draft of literature review on known farmer-predator conflict
 prevention methods.
 2.
 Start identifying and counting the leopards from the previous camera trap
 survey.
 3.
 Finish farmer survey for AgriForum.
 4.
 Finish the Stellenbosch University ethics clearance and MET permit applications.
 5.
 Start sorting the weekly downloaded pictures by species.
 6.
 Possibly visit some of the neighbouring farms.
 Optionally use farmer survey (if any of them do not receive the AgriForum)
 for more data on their management methods.
 7.
 Do field testing on the viability of using spoor tracking and Cybertracker
 for predator spatial behaviour in the rainy season.
 I have tested this at CCF in the dry season and it worked reasonably well
 for leopard kills (at least 3 leopard kills recorded with Cybertracker
 within walking distance of CCF centre).
 Why? 4.
 The data will be analysed when the survey is done, using Resampling Stats
 (add-in for Excel).
 If there are any need for predator/kill ID training and/or game counts
 in the coming months, I can return to CCF for a few days at a time and
 also bring the collected data with for download to CCF hard drives.

Conclusion 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Although the camera trap study will not be able to prove that there has
 been a general increase in leopard numbers (and simultaneous decrease in
 cheetah numbers) in Northern Namibia, it should be able to test if this
 effect as reported by one farmer, is real or not.
 Even if this data can not be extrapolated to the whole of North Central
 Namibia, it can provide supportive evidence that the reported change in
 predator composition on these farmlands are real.
 If there is a real effect, it will imply that more research is needed on
 the causes of the change in predator numbers.
 Any additional data on rainfall, vegetation changes, game and livestock
 numbers and management can also be provided as possible causes for the
 change in predator numbers that needs to be investigated.
 Spoor tracking will later (from July 2014 onward) be used to provide more
 detail on the spatial behaviour of the four predator species that can have
 an economic impact on livestock farming in Northern Namibia.
