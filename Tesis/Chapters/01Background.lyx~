Why? The importance of natural habitat on farmlands for ecological sustainabilit

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\lang british
Predators form an important part of any ecosystem and it has been suggested
 that most ecosystems are actually top-down controlled 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Estes_et_al._2011"

\end_inset

 and therefore susceptible to trophic cascades when top-level predators
 are removed.
 The removal of top predators can cause meso-predator release (e.g.
 the removal of leopards in some areas, may lead to an increase in the number
 of caracals and black-backed jackals).
 Similar increase in meso-predator numbers has been shown in America for
 coyotes as a result of the loss of wolves, cougars or grizzly bears (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Estes_et_al._2011"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Ritchie_and_Johnson_2009"

\end_inset

).
 It follows that an ecosystem without its full complement of predators might
 not be able to deliver ecosystem services sustainably, in addition to the
 wider loss in biodiversity.
 Livestock and game farming in Namibia and the drier areas of Southern Africa
 are dependent on these ecosystem services for their continued sustainability,
 since irrigation and artificially "improved" grazing are seldom viable
 alternatives.

\begin_layout Paragraph

\lang british
Globally, the greatest threat to mammal biodiversity is habitat destruction
 or degradation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Schipper_et_al_2008"

\end_inset

.
 However, for cheetahs in Namibia, direct killing by humans and the resulting
 change in population demographics, have been identified as the greatest
 contributors to their mortality rates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Marker_et_al_2003a"

\end_inset

.
 Current conserved areas are insufficient to ensure the long-term survival
 of large, wide-ranging predators like cheetahs, both because of intra-guild
 hostility by larger, social predators like lions and spotted hyenas inside
 conserved areas (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Ritchie_and_Johnson_2009"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Durant_1998,Durant_2000"

\end_inset

), and because of the minimum required number of individuals needed in a
 population to ensure genetic survival (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Stuart_1981"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp

\end_inset

) combined with the home range size requirements of these species.
 Thus it is not strange that the majority (90% - 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Marker_et_al_2003a"

\end_inset

) of surviving cheetahs in Namibia are found on farmlands outside formally
 conserved areas.
 It is therefore imperative to get buy-in from landowners outside formally
 conserved areas to ensure the long-term survival of these predator species.

Human-wildlife conflict: why another approach?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\lang british
Human-wildlife conflict is an increasing and worldwide problem (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Messmer_2000"

\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Treves_n_Karanth_2003"

\end_inset

), even though a variety of mitigating methods have been proposed (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Nyhus_et_al_2003,Linnell_et_al_1996,Shivik_2004,Daly_et_al_2006,Shivik_2006"

\end_inset

).
 These include proactive methods to prevent the conflict (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Daly_et_al_2006,Shivik_2006"

\end_inset

), methods that increase the value of the wildlife species to offset the
 costs of living with wildlife (e.g.
 regulated harvest of leopard in Uganda [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Treves_n_Karanth_2003"

\end_inset

], wildlife property rights on Namibian farmlands [
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "McGranahan_2008"

\end_inset

], eco-tourism, etc.), and reactive methods including compensation and removal
 of problem animals after-the-fact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\lang british
One of the major reasons for farmer-predator conflict is that farmers have
 to bear the brunt of the costs, although everyone benefits from these ecosystem
 services.
 In a study done for the Red meat Producers Organisation the total annual
 costs of livestock depredation for small livestock farmers in South Africa
 was estimated as R 1 390 453 062 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Van_Niekerk_2010"

\end_inset

.
 For this reason, it can be assumed that the methods most likely to decrease
 conflict between farmers and predators, are those that will maximise the
 benefits and minimise the costs of predators on their land.
 The major predators perceived as a threat to their livelihoods by farmers
 in Northern Namibia, are leopards (
\shape italic
Panthera pardus
\shape default
), cheetahs (
\shape italic
Acinonyx jubatus
\shape default
), caracals (
\shape italic
Felis caracal
\shape default
) and black-backed jackals (
\shape italic
Canis mesomelas
\shape default
).
 Two of these predator species, are classified as vulnerable (
\shape italic
Acinonyx jubatus

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp

) and near-threatened (

Panthera pardus,

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Henschel_et_al_2008"

\end_inset

) by the IUCN.
 A better understanding of the ecological systems as it currently functions
 on Namibian farms, might be the key to better management and prevention
 of livestock losses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\lang british
[A number of farmers have complained of a recent increase in leopard numbers
 and a simultaneous decrease in cheetahs (pers.
 comm.
 Francois Kok, Rolf Ritter and others).
 This shift in species composition could be the result of direct lethal
 confrontation between leopards and cheetahs, "fear and loathing" (
\shape italic
sensu
\shape default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Ritchie_and_Johnson_2009"

\end_inset

) resulting in cheetahs avoiding areas with high leopard density, habitat
 changes caused by bush encroachment, a change in available prey species,
 a disproportionate number of cheetahs killed by humans compared to leopards,
 or other currently unknown reasons.
 While the spatial ecology of Namibian cheetahs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, leopards 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 and caracals 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Marker_n_Dickman_2005a"

\end_inset

 have been studied, the extend and importance of the spatial interaction
 between these predator species is still relatively unknown.
 Since intra-guild interactions can have a huge impact on ecosystems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Sinclair_et_al_2003,Estes_et_al._2011"

\end_inset

, and the current human-predator conflict might largely be the result of
 changes in the predator species composition on farmland ecosystems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Beinart_1998,Daly_et_al_2006,Ritchie_and_Johnson_2009"

\end_inset

, a better understanding of these interactions could lead to both better
 conservation and less human-wildlife conflict.
 Unfortunately, neither farmers nor predators can wait until all these ecologica
l research has been finished before they have to make management decisions
 â€“ which can have disastrous effects on both farmers and predators if wrong.]
