\begin_layout Abstract
Although many methods has been suggested to mitigate human-predator conflict,
 it is still a worldwide and increasingly important problem, both for predator
 conservation and for livestock farming.
 In the past most solutions to this conflict has been either from an agricultura
l perspective or from a conservation perspective.
 However, because the goals of these two perspectives are seldom the same,
 there has been frustratingly little progress in preventing human-wildlife
 conflict.
 Here we review different published methods used worldwide to alleviate
 human-wildlife conflict, specifically conflict between livestock farmers
 and predators, the pros and cons of each method and the probable usefulness
 of the different methods to livestock farmers in North Central Namibia.
 We propose a more useful classification of methods than the usual lethal
 non-lethal dichotomy, and compare the various methods in terms of their
 success and cost-effectiveness.
 We also investigate the possible reasons for both failures and successes
 of the different methods.
 Lastly we propose that a new approach is needed if we want practical and
 sustainable solutions to our current human-wildlife conflicts.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Human-wildlife conflict is a growing global problem 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Messmer_2000,Treves_n_Karanth_2003b,Nyhus_et_al_2005"

\end_inset

.
 This has implications both for agriculture and for conservation.
 Indeed, some authors have considered the conflict to be human-human conflict
 between agriculturalists and conservation ecologists, rather than between
 farmers and wildlife 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Treves_n_Karanth_2003,Conradie_n_Piesse_2013,Nattrass_n_Conradie_2013"

\end_inset

.
 This imply that any solution to the conflict should address both the agricultur
al perspective and the ecological perspective.
 Although using the general term "human-wildlife conflict" (HWC), this article
 really focus on carnivores and more specifically on predators.
 So the terms "human-carnivore conflict" 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Khorozyan_et_al_2015"

\end_inset

, "farmer-predator conflict" 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Potgieter_et_al_2016"

\end_inset

 will be used interchangeably, with the understanding that "human-wildlife
 conflict" as used here refers not only to carnivores in general (which
 includes scavengers), but specifically to conflict arising from depredation
 of livestock.
 We will be focussing on commercial livestock farming in Namibia, while
 keeping in mind that the same methods could work in other areas with similar
 circumstances and predators.
 The issue of game farming and conflict caused by depredation of valuable
 game animals, is really a separate question and will not be considered
 here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From an ecological perspective it is known that the greatest threat to large
 mammalian carnivores and sharks is direct killing by humans 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Treves_n_Bruskotter_2014"

\end_inset

, an even greater immediate threat than habitat destruction, especially
 in Africa 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Ray_et_al_2005"

\end_inset

.
 This includes killing of carnivores in retaliation for livestock depredation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Ogada_et_al_2003"

\end_inset

.
 Large carnivores, often apex predators, need large home ranges or territories
 to sustain themselves, making them more vulnerable to extinction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cardillo_et_al_2004,Schipper_et_al_2008"

\end_inset

.
 This is exemplified by the cheetah (
\shape italic
Acinonyx jubatus

), classified as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Durant_et_al_2015"

\end_inset

.
 In Namibia, the country with the largest surviving population of cheetahs
 in the world 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Marker_1998,Marker_et_al_2003b,Durant_et_al_2015"

\end_inset

, an estimated 90% of cheetahs are found on commercial livestock farms (private
 ranches) outside formally protective reserves 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Marker_2000,Marker_et_al_2003a"

\end_inset

 with being shot on livestock farms the major cause of death 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Marker_et_al_2010"

\end_inset

.
 In Southern Africa, most of the vulnerable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Stein_et_al_2016"

\end_inset

 leopard (
\shape italic
Panthera pardus

) habitat is found outside protected areas and the major threat to leopard
 survival is direct killing by people
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Swanepoel_et_al_2015"

\end_inset

.
 The same high percentage of habitat outside conserved areas is true for
 tigers, jaguars and snow leopards (Miquelle et al., 1999; Nowell & Jackson,
 1996; quoted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Dickman_et_al_2011"

\end_inset

).
 With farmers as the custodians of the majority of land in most countries
 of the world, the ultimate survival of many species are squarely in the
 hands of farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A telephone survey by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Van_Niekerk_2010"

\end_inset

 showed that livestock farmers in South Africa claimed a total annual loss
 of R 1 390 453 062 worth of livestock directly to predators 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bergman_et_al_2013"

\end_inset

.
 These losses were unequally distributed with some districts and some farmers
 having much higher losses than the average (see also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Conradie_n_Piesse_2013"

\end_inset

).
 Similarly, data from the official government-sponsored hunting clubs for
 the period 1979-1987 in the Ceres South district 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Conradie_n_Piesse_2013"

\end_inset

and Cooper hunting club 1976-1981 outside Mossel Bay 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bailey_n_Conradie_2013"

\end_inset

 showed average losses of 1.48 livestock units per farm and 0.94 sheep per
 farm per year, but with highs of up to 114 sheep lost in a single year
 to predators on a single farm.
 In the area around the Waterberg in North-Central Namibia, farmers lost
 on average 3.8% of their calves to depredation annually (US$1370 per farm
 per year according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Stein_et_al_2010"

\end_inset

).
 In a slightly wider area of North-Central Namibia, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Marker_et_al_2003b"

\end_inset

 found that farmers who claimed cheetah problems on average lost 16.7 (2%)
 of their cattle and 18.0 (5.3%) of their small livestock per year for the
 period 1991-1993 and those who claimed cheetahs as not problematic lost
 on average 6.8 (1.3%) of their cattle and 11.5 (4.3%) of their small livestock
 to predators.
 In 1993-1999 the numbers changed to an average of 5.8 cattle lost per year
 by farmers who claimed cheetahs as problematic and 1.2 by those who did
 not consider cheetahs problematic, while they lost on average 8.5 and 12.1
 small livestock respectively.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Lindsey_et_al_2013c"

\end_inset

found the average annual livestock losses reported due to leopards over
 most of Namibia's commercial farm areas to be US$2,644/farm to leopards,
 almost double that reported by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Stein_et_al_2010"

\end_inset

 earlier.
 If we keep in mind that we might have a similar uneven distribution of
 livestock depredation between farms as shown by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Conradie_n_Piesse_2013"

\end_inset

 in the Ceres Karoo, the losses of some individual farmers could be very
 high.
 These kinds of losses are not economically insignificant, and a study at
 the Glen Agricultural Institute near Bloemfontein in the Free State, found
 that black-backed jackal (
\shape italic
Canis mesomelas

) and caracal (
\shape italic

\shape default
) depredation of the Merino and Dorper sheep made it ultimately unsustainable
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bergman_et_al_2013"

\end_inset

.
 In addition to direct losses, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Howery_n_DeLiberto_2004"

\end_inset

 make the point that behavioural changes in livestock because of predation
 risk, can cause significant decreases in production and reproduction rates.
 In the final instance, while everybody benefit from a functioning and biodivers
e ecosystem, the cost of conserving large and sometimes dangerous animals
 is often borne disproportionately by farmers

Predators fulfil an important role in functioning ecosystems, and their
 extermination has many unintended consequences, including trophic cascades
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, and there is good reason to believe that predators are a major driver
 of high biodiversity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 of relatively species-rich ecosystems on livestock farms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

Past approaches

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many different methods have been proposed and implemented in the past to
 mitigate human-wildlife conflict (HWC).
 In general these methods varied in costs and effectiveness from doing nothing
 (free-range, extensive farming, zero cost and zero effectiveness) to feeding
 lots or barns (fed livestock, intensive farming, very high costs and almost
 100% effective against predators).
 Methods for mitigating HWC have generally been classified as "lethal" or
 "non-lethal" (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Daly_et_al_2006,Shivik_2004"

\end_inset

), the general implication being that "lethal" methods are not environmentally
 friendly or ecologically sustainable and that "non-lethal" methods are
 to be preferred.
 However, this classification runs into problems when it is realized that
 a generally accepted "non-lethal" method, like using livestock guarding
 dogs, can be very lethal indeed, and might even be approved by farmers
 because it is lethal to some predators (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Potgieter_et_al_2016,Potgieter_et_al_2013"

\end_inset

)! Additionally, a "non-lethal" method like relocation of problem predators,
 sometimes not only fail to stop livestock depredation on the farm from
 which the predator has been removed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Linnell_et_al_1997"

\end_inset

, but in the case of territorial animals like leopards, can result in the
 death of either the newly introduced individual or it killing one of the
 current residents to take over its territory.
 This has a ripple effect in the receiving population with an increase in
 sexually selected infanticide 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Keehner_et_al_2015,Balme_et_al_2009a"

\end_inset

, similar to typical effects of trophy hunting.
 Moreover, because predators often travel for long distances, it can simply
 relocate the problem of livestock depredation to another area when the
 relocated predator leaves the conserved area to which it had been moved
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Fischer_n_Lindenmayer_2000,Weilenmann_et_al_2010,Weise_et_al_2015a,Weise_et_al_2015b"

\end_inset

.
 In effect, a so-called "non-lethal" method still result in the death of
 one one or more predators 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Treves_n_Karanth_2003"

\end_inset

 and some conservationists conclude that it is sometimes better to simply
 kill problem individuals, rather than trying to relocate them 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Stander_1990b,Ropiquet_et_al_2015"

\end_inset

.
 Some researchers have questioned the very existence of such "problem animals"
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Linnell_et_al_1999"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternative classifications for farmer-predator conflict mitigating techniques
 have been proposed.
 If the conflict is taken to its logical possible outcomes, there are only
 3 possible endpoints: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The conflict continues, farmers win and the predators are extirpated on
 farmlands (the result reached in most of Europe and for top predators like
 lions and spotted hyaenas on most Southern African farms), 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The conflict continues, predators win and livestock farming becomes impossible
 on the land, forcing a switch to other other agricultural activities like
 tillage and crop production or non-agricultural land uses, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Farmers and predators make peace and somehow learn to co-exist.
 This could be achieved through either lethal or non-lethal conflict mitigating
 methods.
 The aim is a win-win situation for both livestock and predators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Treves_n_Karanth_2003"

\end_inset

 classified historic methods to reduce human carnivore conflict into three
 basic strategies: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Eradication, where the predators are extirpated on farmlands.
 This is the approach usually followed by governments in the past and advocated
 by many agricultural organizations (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Bergman_et_al_2013,Rust_2016*"

\end_inset

).
 This equates to the first end-point of the conflict mentioned above (farmers
 win) if "successful".
 If unsuccessful, it could lead to the "predators win" endpoint.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Regulated harvest, where predators are hunted or killed, but without the
 aim to eradicate them from farmlands.
 This is seldom effective 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Treves_n_Karanth_2003"

\end_inset

 and can even worsen the situation for both farmers and the ecosystem 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Conradie_n_Piesse_2013,Bailey_n_Conradie_2013,Bothma_2012,DeWet2002"

\end_inset

.
 This could result in either the predators "winning" or accidental eradication
 of predators (if unsuccessful) or co-existence (if successfully implemented).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Preservation, where non-lethal methods are used, leading to coexistence
 of farmers and predators on the land.
 These methods are often expensive or difficult to implement 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Treves_n_Karanth_2003"

\end_inset

.
 This would result in either the second endpoint (farming unsustainable)
 if unsuccessful or the last endpoint (peaceful coexistence) if successful.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Treves_n_Karanth_2003"

\end_inset

 split these non-lethal methods into either methods that change predator
 behaviour or methods that physically keep predators separate from livestock.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Shivik_2004"

 subdivided non-lethal methods into three, 1) altering human behaviour,
 2) altering husbandry or 3) altering predator behaviour.
 In truth, since all of these methods will need to be implemented by humans,
 most likely the land-owners or farmers, and are presumably not currently
 being implemented, all of them depend on altering human behaviour.

 classified methods used to address human-wildlife conflict into 5 groups:
 1) physical/spatial (e.g.
 fences); 2) economic (e.g.
 incentive schemes); 3) technical (e.g.
 husbandry or farming methods); 4) legal (e.g.
 anti-poaching or quotas); 5) biological (e.g.
 using wild prey or predator behaviour).

 suggested that zoning should be used to determine which methods to apply,
 with 1) a conservation zone (preservation/ non-lethal methods only), 2)
 a buffer zone (including regulated harvest) and 3) the outside area (eradicatio
n/lethal methods only).
 They make the point that the choice of method depends also on the conservation
 status of the predators involved in the conflict, whether a "carnivore
 species / population is abundant, with no danger of global or regional
 extermination"; or a "carnivore species / population is rare with a risk
 of regional and / or global extermination." They still use the familiar
 division of methods into lethal and non-lethal, with lethal methods exclusively
 used in the "outside area" zone and only non-lethal methods used in the
 "conservation zone".
 However, they were looking at HWC in a Norwegian or European context, which
 differs substantially from the Southern African situation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that non-lethal methods are not always "non-lethal" and that "lethal"
 methods can occasionally be better from both an ecological and an agricultural
 point of view, it is proposed that a more useful view of methods when evaluatin
g them for management decision-making might be a threefold classification:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Preventative (pre-emptive) methods that attempt to prevent livestock depredation
 by carnivores.
 Both lethal (e.g.
 eradication of predators) and non-lethal methods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Shivik_2004,Daly_et_al_2006,Shivik_2006"

\end_inset

 could be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Incentive (compensation/offset) methods (e.g.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Stander_et_al_1997c,Mishra_et_al_2003"

\end_inset

).
 Generally these methods do not prevent or decrease livestock depredation,
 but in some way compensate farmers for the presence of predators on their
 land, to the extent that they would conserve rather than exterminate predators
 on their land.
 Once again, both non-lethal methods (non-consumptive use) and lethal methods
 (e.g.
 trophy hunting of predators) could be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reactive methods that only react to livestock depredation, rather than trying
 to prevent it.
 Although many of these methods seem essentially the same as methods used
 in the previous two groups (e.g.
 hunting of predators), the fact that they are only used in reaction to
 actual livestock losses, means that they differ both in costs and effectiveness.
 They can be cheaper to implement (less often used) and have a smaller negative
 effect on the range-land ecosystem on farms, while having a higher risk
 of livestock losses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using this classification, we can now examine the different methods used
 in the past.
 Frequently the "same method" can be used in more than one of these three
 ways with different costs and effectiveness and should thus be considered
 as different methods.
 For evaluation purposes, the pros and cons as well as limitations of each
 method are mentioned.
 Pros (advantages) as used here, are positive aspects of the specific method
 that can be put on a scale of 1 to 10 while cons (disadvantages) are negative
 aspects of the method that can also be plotted on a scale of -1 to -10.
 Limitations measures the practicality of a method with a binary value of
 either true (practical in these circumstances) or false (impractical in
 other circumstances).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In parts of Namibia, because of grazing and drinking water limitations,
 farms larger than 20 000 ha and with single camps of 5000 ha are not uncommon,
 making some otherwise good methods simply impractical.
 Farming enterprises are generally considered as intensive or extensive.
 In general, a more intensive farming system attempt to maximize production
 or profit per hectare or per livestock unit while an extensive farming
 system attempt to minimize costs per hectare or livestock unit.
 These are not clear-cut categories and most farms fall somewhere on a scale
 between very intensive (e.g.
 typical of a dairy farm with small pastures of cultivated grazing crops,
 cows walking only very short distances per day, each cow handled twice
 per day and receiving individualized feeding based on milk production,
 expensive infrastructure and fairly labour-intensive or mechanized) to
 very extensive (large herds of livestock basically free-ranging with few
 water points available, having to walk long distances to get to grazing
 and drinking water, gathered and handled only once every six months and
 then moved to whatever part of the farm has received rain within the previous
 year).
 Even on the same farm, different livestock species or breeds can be managed
 at different levels between intensive and extensive, with small livestock
 for example, sleeping in a kraal every night and being counted daily, while
 cattle are free-ranging in camps further away from the farm homestead and
 only gathered once or twice a year.
 Different limitations will determine how intensive the farming system can
 be, including availability of drinking water points, rainfall and stocking
 rates that can be sustained on the land, terrain and impassibility of roads,
 current infrastructure on the farm, capital available to the farmer for
 improvements, if the farmer is doing other work for an additional income
 (so-called "weekend farmers"), etc.
 After considering various measures of intensive 
\shape italic
versus 
\shape default
extensive farming, including stocking rates (livestock units per hectare
 per year), economic carrying capacity, size of the farm, number of labourers,
 infrastructure and mechanization, etc.
 all of which can be relevant, it was decided to use a simplified classification
 of farming systems by how often the farmer sees or handles all the livestock
 on his farm.
 For the sake of considering its importance as a limiting factor for methods
 to decrease livestock depredation, intensive farming is considered as a
 system where the livestock owner sees or handles all his livestock at least
 once per day, a medium intensive system is where the livestock owner sees
 all his livestock at least once per week, a medium extensive system is
 where the farmer sees all his livestock at least once per month and extensive
 farming is where the farmer sees or handles all his livestock less than
 once per month.

 However, this was not the only or even the most important predictor of
 farmer tolerance of predators.
 What is often not kept in mind, is that the risk of depredation losses
 can influence the attitude of a livestock owner just as much or even more
 than actual losses.
 Paradoxically, other studies have shown that in some cases the actual number
 of livestock losses to predators have little influence on farmer attitudes

 showed that livestock farmers and conservationists approach the problem
 of farmer-jackal conflict from two opposite starting points (narratives).
 Livestock farmers generally want to maximize production or profits per
 hectare of land and minimize their risk.
 Environmentalists generally want to maximize biodiversity.
 However, both groups share the following aims: 1) minimize conflict, 2)
 minimize cost, and 3) maximize sustainability.
 Since greater biodiversity also leads to greater sustainability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cadotte_et_al_2012"

\end_inset

 this means that farmers and conservationists share all their aims, except
 for the two agricultural aims (maximizing production and minimizing livelihood
 risk).
 One would therefore expect the two groups to be natural allies, but that
 does not always happen.
 One reason for the lack of cooperation might be because farmers do not
 often have an ecosystem-wide view of their farms and thus do not realize
 the importance of biodiversity for the sustainability of their farming
 enterprises.
 On the other hand, conservationists also often focus on one or a few carnivore
 species when communicating with farmers, and therefore share part of the
 blame for this blinkered view of the issues.

 reach our aims of biodiversity, sustainability and livelihood production

The most superficial level of conflict and the one addressed by all these
 methods discussed in the previous section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "sec:Past-approaches"

\end_inset

 to prevent, compensate or react to human-wildlife conflict, is known as
 a dispute.
 It is typified by the interaction between two strangers with no previous
 history, becoming involved in conflict that is fairly easily resolved by
 an agreed settlement on how the dispute should be resolved (i.e.
 an implementation of one or more of the HWC mitigation methods discussed
 in our context acceptable to both sides).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When the two parties have a history of past unresolved disputes, this is
 typical of some underlying conflict.
 Because farmers often do not distinguish between different conservation
 NGOs and the government's Ministry of Environment and Tourism, simply grouping
 them all together as conservationists, negative previous experiences with
 any of these groups can cause underlying conflict that will not be solved
 by "quick answer" methods for resolving human-wildlife conflict.
 E.g.
 a promise by nature conservation personnel that they will translocate any
 captured leopards from farmlands to a national park, followed by promises,
 but no actions after repeated telephone calls from a farmer who had to
 feed the captured leopard for more than a week, led not only to the leopard
 being shot, but to farmers in the whole district distrusting any promises
 or information from anybody involved with nature conservation about predators
 (personal observation).
 Trust has been broken, and any conflict resolution approach that do not
 first rebuild the trust, will never work.
 Similarly, all farmers are not the same, nor share the same basic views
 on predators and the desirability of coexistence on farmlands 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rust_2016*"

\end_inset

, but past experiences with some farmers is one reason why many conservationists
 do not consider livestock farmers as their natural allies in conserving
 biodiversity.
 At this level of conflict, not only the specific instance of farmer-predator
 conflict (the current dispute) needs to be resolved, but all those past
 unresolved disputes also need to be addressed before a true resolution
 of the underlying conflict can result.
 If conservationists (and farmers associations) are not aware of these kind
 of past histories, it can cause lots of frustrations when superficial settlemen
ts do not result in the expected cooperation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Identity conflict is the third and deepest level of conflict and involves
 values, beliefs, or social-psychological needs that are central to the
 identity of at least one of the parties involved in the conflict.
 One very important motivating reason for any young man to choose farming
 as career, is that you work for yourself.
 Few (if any) farmers choose it as a career primarily for economic reasons.
 Thus independence from undue outside influence is an important motivating
 factor for farmers, and they can experience any efforts by conservationists
 to protect predators on farmlands as an attack not only on their livelihoods,
 but also on their identity as independent farmers.
 On the other hand, for conservationists whose identity focus on the conservatio
n of wildlife, any action that threaten to extirpate a species may be considered
 as a profound moral violation.
 Typical of this level is a strong "us 
\shape italic
versus
\shape default
 them" view of human-carnivore conflict.
 Communication between the groups become minimal and the little communication
 there is, is often misunderstood or interpreted in a prejudicial way.
 Reconciliation only becomes possible once both sides make a definite decision
 that they need each other as partners to find practical solutions to a
 common problem.
 Building trust in small steps through being transparent and honest about
 your own viewpoint as well as fair and truly sympathetic to the other viewpoint

 For example, just the size of Namibian farms makes any method that depends

 Where farmers feel excluded from the decision-making process about predators

 However, in practice, working together is much more likely to result in
 win-win solutions (sustainable coexistence).
 It is thus interesting that almost all compensation schemes that had some
 level of success, were those in which the livestock owners participated

 between farmers and their workers, can have an effect on farmer-predator
 conflict.
 Building relationships through transparency and trust, is the second aspect
 of reconciliation needed for conflict resolution mentioned by

 They show the importance of such relationship building by the example of
 conservationists finding a solution to human-elephant conflict through
 asking questions and consulting with a local community, resulting in a
 decision to use various kinds of fences.
 However, when they later tried to apply the same method in other communities
 without a similar period of consultation and trust relationship building,
 those same methods did not succeed, with community members failing to implement
 or maintain chilly peppers and breaking down fences.

The final and perhaps most obvious part of resolving deep-rooted identity
 conflict, involves the actual substance of practical and cost-effective
 methods to mitigate farmer-predator conflict.
 Here the suitability of a certain method to conditions on a certain farm
 has often not been considered sufficiently.
 A number of researchers have mentioned that predation losses does not seem
 to be uniformly distributed, even within the same district 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, and some farmers might have extremely high depredation losses, while the
 majority have relatively few losses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This appears to be an international feature of farmer-predator conflict,

\end_inset

 and the USA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 But different levels of depredation also imply that different management
 decisions and different anti-predation methods are required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize some of the main reasons why past human-carnivore conflict
 mitigation approaches still fail to reduce the conflict:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They often approach the conflict from either an ecological, conservationist
 viewpoint only or from an agricultural, short-term economic viewpoint only.
 Conservationists therefore frequently advise farmers to use eco-friendly
 methods that are impractical or not economically viable.
 Agriculturalists, on the other hand, often advise methods that appear to
 give short-term results, but are not sustainable in the long run and might
 actually aggravate the situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They usually only directly address the human-predator conflict itself and
 only recently started taking into account the social aspects of human-human
 conflict.
 But even so, the focus is often on social aspects of the conflict that
 might at best be a contributing factor (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Rust_et_al_2016"

\end_inset

) while ignoring the deeper levels of conflict 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Madden_n_McQuinn_2014"

\end_inset

 between the ecological and the agricultural basic starting points 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nattrass_n_Conradie_2013"

\end_inset

 that might be the most important reason why farmers are unwilling to risk
 or trust in "new" methods.
 Farmers themselves often feel left out and not well represented as partners
 in predator management decisions and advice (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 when commenting on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 The importance of farmers as full partners in predator conservation on
 farmlands, and the final implementers of any HWC mitigating methods, as
 well as having to personally bear the brunt of all costs and risks, is
 seldom explicitly recognized.
 Farmers associations and agricultural unions are seldom put in the situation
 where they can share ownership of ecologically sound solutions to human-wildlif
e conflict (

Past approaches very seldom (if ever) take cognisance of the differences
 between individual farms and farmers with regards to both ecological and
 agricultural aspects of the situation.
 The approach is often that of "one size fits all".

Conservationists in particular are often guilty of not spelling out the
 known drawbacks and limitations of proposed solutions to livestock depredation
 and HWC, thereby creating unrealistic expectations (see for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 When farmers run into these, often unexpected, issues, they can become
 discouraged and return to their known and trusted (even if not very effective)
 "traditional" and unsustainable management practices.
 Not only do they personally abandon any of the possibly more effective
 methods, but typically they also spread the word that a certain method
 "did not work for me", discouraging other farmers from attempting it as
 well 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 education and husbandry training to reduce livestock depredation.
 It is often amazing how little farmers know about the general behaviour
 of the predators found on their land.

 in our knowledge of predator behaviour outside protected areas

 As farms have become larger in order to remain economically viable and
 farming methods are often more extensive than they used to be 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nattrass_n_Conradie_2013"

\end_inset

, farmers often also know surprisingly little about the behaviour of their
 own livestock (especially their anti-predator behaviour).
 This lack of knowledge can result in basic mistakes being made (like de-horning
 of all cattle), leading to unnecessary livestock losses.
 The lack of significant effect by any other method except the numbers of
 wildlife on farms in Namibia found by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 protection measures are implemented is possibly more important than which
 method is used.

While often making the mistake of offering a "one size fits all" solution

Because farming is inherently risky, farmers tend to be risk-averse and
 to keep to what they know.
 The problem with this approach is that circumstances have changed and keep
 on changing.
 Methods that were affordable and effective in the past, are so no longer
 because of changes in costs, legislation, ecological changes, etc.

 opined that future methods "need to emerge from a mix of biology, sociology,
 and technology".
 It is well known that there is no silver bullet for human-wildlife conflict

 What works well against some predators and in some circumstances, will
 fail in different situations.
 And, except for permanently keeping all livestock in a barn and feeding
 them, no method is 100% effective in preventing livestock depredation losses.
 The aim should be to find the most cost-effective and sustainable method
 or combination of methods that fit the situation on a specific farm.
 For this reason, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Shivik_2004"

\end_inset

 proposed that livestock depredation control should be approached similarly
 to Integrated Pest Management (IPM).
 But it is not enough to know what method is most likely to succeed, unless
 farmers are empowered to make the decision for themselves using relevant
 knowledge, the uptake of better methods for preventing farmer-predator
 conflict will probably remain low because of the various social issues
 mentioned above.
 It is important that the advantages, disadvantages and limitations of the
 various methods available to a farmer should be known up-front before he
 commits himself to implementing it on his farm.
 The process by which any specific method is chosen and recommended should
 also be clear and transparent to the farmer in order to avoid any unexpected
 nasty surprises during implementation.

So what should we do differently from what has already been tried? It should
 be clear by now the the primary decision-maker and ultimate implementer
 of any methods to decrease conflict with predators and livestock losses,
 should be the livestock farmer himself, since he will ultimately have to
 bear the costs of any method that he decide on as well as having to deal
 with the consequences, whether good or bad

 It seems clear that conservation of larger predators is not possible without
 including livestock farmers in the process.
 But the common request for conservation education and husbandry training
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 show that farmers need the right information in their hands on both the
 agricultural cost-effectiveness of different methods and its ecological
 sustainability.
 One of the most important aspects of applying any predation-prevention
 method, is the good record keeping of the current situation on the farm
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Stone_et_al_2008"

\end_inset

.
 Knowing how much livestock is lost to predators, where most depredation
 happens in the farm and which predators are responsible is basic knowledge
 that is required in order to make good management decisions.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hoogesteijn_n_Hoogesteijn_2010"

\end_inset

 actually consider it as a preventative method by itself.
 It should be pointed out that good record-keeping is not necessarily correlated
 to how intensive the farming system is.
 Even when livestock is only seen once every six months, through the use
 of individual ear tags, together with a weighing scale, the history of
 every cow can be recorded and used in breeding and other management decisions.
 Computer expert systems that capture expert human knowledge and use it
 in various applications, have existed since the 1970s and became relatively
 popular in the 1980s.
 A decision support system (DSS) is a specific type of expert systems where
 the aim is not so much automation or artificial intelligence, but to provide
 human decision makers with the relevant information needed to make an informed
 decision 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a DSS avoids a number of the possible reasons for the past failure
 of mitigating methods to reduce HWC.
 Because it is not a person "telling the farmer what to do on his own farm",
 at least part of the common underlying distrust of conservation scientists
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nattrass_n_Conradie_2013"

\end_inset

 or past bad experiences with specific conservationists, is avoided (Axel
 Rothauge 2014, personal communication).
 If the DSS is written in order to be transparent with regards to the algorithms
 and data it uses, not only does it make it easier to trust it, but if written
 as open source software, it can be updated and improved as new knowledge
 and research becomes available.
 Ultimately it would use feedback from farmers themselves who are using
 various methods, to re-evaluate or update the basic data used (e.g.
 as costs change or if more limitations of a specific method is found).
 A feedback loop is thus built into the DSS allowing it to adapt to changing
 circumstances (e.g.
 changes in costs of different methods).
 The algorithm used will include both the short-term agricultural economic
 cost-effectiveness of the various methods and the long-term ecological
 sustainability in order to choose the most appropriate method for the specific
 situation on a farm as entered by the farmer.
 This is in effect using an ecologically holistic view of the farming system,
 looking at the whole ecosystem and not considering livestock depredation
 as an isolated problem

.
 By presenting only the top three methods with their limitations, pros and
 cons, the farmer will have the required information available to make informed
 decisions on what to do to decrease livestock losses, without being overwhelmed
 with irrelevant data.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many different approaches to human-wildlife conflict have been used in the
 past, with partial success.
 Many farmers still prefer to kill predators on their land or to engage
 in unsustainable farming practices, without the issue being resolved.
 Human-wildlife conflict still remain the major cause of death for many
 predators, but ultimately farmers remain the custodians of predators on
 their land and need to be empowered to do a better job of managing their
 land, including both agricultural aspects and ecological aspects of farmer-pred
ator conflict.
 An online decision support system can put the relevant knowledge into the
 hands of farmers who are struggling with livestock depredation on their
 land.
 It can also be updated periodically, making sure that it remains current.
 In time, the model can be expanded or adapted to include communal farming
 systems
