Preventative methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Active hunting of predators has been one of the first methods used in the
 Cape of Good Hope by Dutch farmers.
 It appears seemingly obvious that getting rid of the predators will prevent
 carnivores from killing livestock, which is one reason why this method
 is still favoured by some farmers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Killing predators can be done with a number of different objectives, however

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Of these different aims, the selective removing of individual predators
 is not pre-emptive, since the predator must first kill livestock (repeatedly)
 before it can be identified as a "problem individual".
 Historically a number of methods have been used to exterminate predators
 from farmlands

Hunting to exterminate predators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Active hunting of predators resulted in the extermination of most of the
 larger predators like lions from farmlands 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Beinart_1998"

\end_inset

.
 However, it was not successful against jackals and caracals on its own
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "DeWet2002,DeWet_2006"

\end_inset

, illustrating that different predators are often differently impacted by
 hunting 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kissui_2008"

\end_inset

.
 Instead, the numbers of jackals and caracals actually increased as the
 larger predators were removed from the land because of meso-predator release
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Ritchie_and_Johnson_2009"

\end_inset

.
 From the the time of Van Riebeeck (1650's) until the 1950's when it was
 finally replaced by hunting clubs, a bounty system was commonly used as
 added incentive to kill predators.
 As could be expected, this system was abused in various ways 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Beinart_1998,Nattrass_n_Conradie_2013"

\end_inset

.
 In recent decades, techniques have changed to include hunting by night
 using sound recordings (of prey or other predators) and spotlights to "call"
 predators, or shooting from the air using helicopters.
 Often semi-professional hunters are paid to "get rid" of the predators
 on a farm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: Once a predator species has been locally extirpated in a whole
 district or larger ecosystem, it is relatively cheap to maintain.
 Among other things, it means that livestock can freely range on the land
 without the need for kraaling or herding, leading to longer grazing times,
 better veld utilization and higher productivity if used together with camps
 and rotational grazing.
 It is also relatively simple to implement, with little need for specialized
 knowledge or equipment.
 In highly transformed landscapes, with little or no natural prey available
 to predators (and livestock being their only possible source of food),
 it is often the only realistic short-term option.
 It can also be combined with other methods to eradicate and then exclude
 predators from specific parts of a farm.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Shwiff_n_Bodenchuk_2004"

\end_inset

, in addition to the livestock saved, it can also have secondary tangible
 advantages (e.g.
 more game because of predator control) and intangible advantages (like
 farmers being more positive towards conservation because they are allowed
 to kill predators).
 However, they also make the very questionable statement that "it is desirable
 but not necessary to achieve economic efficiency in predation management
 programs".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: Since hunting is relatively labour intensive, it is also
 expensive in terms of time and money initially.
 It can be very expensive, especially when professional hunters and helicopters
 are used.
 It is very unlikely to succeed, except for conspicuous, large predators
 that are easy to find and kill 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Beinart_1998,Kissui_2008"

\end_inset

.
 Killing these top predators have other unwanted results, like an explosion
 in numbers of medium-sized predators (meso-predator release) and often
 do not solve the actual problem of livestock depredation (and as shown
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Conradie_n_Piesse_2013"

\end_inset

, might actually increase livestock losses).
 Using a 60 year data set, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Berger_2006"

\end_inset

 showed that although US government-subsidised predator control was very
 effective in killing predators, specifically coyotes, it had no effect
 on sheep production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: Unless there are official government support, with all farmers
 and land-owners in a district working together, it is very unlikely to
 succeed.
 It is thus not practical for a single farmer to implement without the support
 of all his neighbours.
 Moreover, it is really only suitable to transformed landscapes (e.g.
 cultivated pastures) where no natural habitat or prey survive for predators
 (e.g.
 parts of Europe) and not well suited for most of Africa 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Linnell_et_al_1996"

\end_inset

.
 Factors like rainfall, topography and soil fertility also limits the practicali
ty of deliberately transforming the vegetation.
 Where the predator species are endangered or otherwise important for a
 functioning and sustainable ecosystem, this method is not an option.

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\lang british
Hunting with dogs for eradication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Dogs are often used together with hunting for exterminating predators.
 Therefore it shares the same advantages and disadvantages as hunting for
 eradication, while adding a few extras.
 Already in the early 1800 Lord Charles Somerset introduced the English
 sport of fox hunting to the Cape for hunting jackals.
 By this time most larger predators had already been extirpated and jackals
 were the major remaining cause of livestock depredation for sheep farmers.
 Since 1962 breeding centres for hunting hounds were established in a number
 of places in the old Cape Province, and even later Oranjejag, in the Free
 State province, used dogs for hunting 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Daly_et_al_2006,Bergman_et_al_2013"

\end_inset

.
 This method has also recently been used in Namibia with "great success",
 if success is measured as numbers of carnivores killed (Rothauge 2014,
 personal communication).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: Using smell, dogs can be much more effective in finding predators
 than human trackers alone.
 However, a group of well-trained dogs are probably still cheaper than using
 helicopters or professional hunters.
 This method is therefore more likely to succeed against smaller predators
 like jackals and caracals than hunting without dogs for the extermination
 of predators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: The greatest disadvantage of using dogs have been the indiscrimin
ate nature of their hunting behaviour.
 Even well-trained dogs that can distinguish between prey animals (which
 should not be killed for various reasons) and carnivores, do not generally
 differentiate between damage-causing predator species and other carnivores,
 with the result that many non-target carnivores like bat-eared foxes, Cape
 foxes, aardwolves, servals, and African Wild Cats are killed as well 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bothma_2012"

\end_inset

.
 More-over, even among the target species the individuals are killed indiscrimin
ately.
 For eradication hunting with dogs has been a dismal failure, resulting
 in many predators killed, but with little long-term decrease in predator
 numbers or livestock depredation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Daly_et_al_2006"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, dogs can have a devastating effect on the natural prey of
 predators and on innocent carnivores and if not well-trained, can even
 kill livestock.
 If outside dog packs are rented to kill predators, some dog handlers only
 use male dogs in their hunting pack, knowing full well that male dogs often
 will not kill female jackals, thus ensuring that they will have work in
 the following years when the female had bred again.
 Needless to say, eradication will never happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: Good hunting dogs require good training.
 This is both time-consuming and not always effective when considering the
 number of non-target animals typically killed.
 It has similar constraints than hunting to eradicate predators, with the
 need for at least district-wide collaboration, government support to make
 it affordable, and transformed landscapes with compromised ecosystems and
 very little natural habitat or prey to have any real chance of decreasing
 livestock losses.

Poison bait to exterminate predators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Poison were being used in the Cape for eradicating problem predators from
 the 1880's 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Beinart_1998,Bergman_et_al_2013"

\end_inset

.
 Different poisons have been used, including Strychnine, Compound 1080 (Sodium
 monofluoroacetate), Sodium Cyanide, and Thallium Sulphate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Linnell_et_al_1996"

\end_inset

.
 The use of poisons were largely discontinued and replaced with jackal-proof
 fencing and hunting clubs in the early 1900, mostly because of the ineffectiven
ess of poison, in addition to the negative ecological side-effects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Beinart_1998"

\end_inset

.
 Poison can applied in different ways, including poisoning carcasses, bait,
 coyote getters, and poisoned collars.
 Because poison collars normally include the death of the livestock animal
 that are killed by the predator, it is considered a reactive method and
 not discussed here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: The only real advantage that poisons have, is that it is easy
 to use and some poisons are easy to acquire.
 But is this truly an advantage? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: It is almost impossible to use poison to selectively kill
 predators.
 Historically it has been more successful in killing scavengers than predators
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Beinart_1998"

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, while killing many non-target carnivores, poison has not been
 able to exterminate jackals or decrease livestock losses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: Poison is an indiscriminate killer and not really effective
 for reducing livestock depredation.
 Historically it was discontinued in the early 1900's already, mostly because
 it was found to be ineffective 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Beinart_1998"

\end_inset

.
 It also has far-reaching negative ecological effects.
 Overall, it has a lot of disadvantages, targeting scavengers, rather than
 predators, being indiscriminate and largely ineffective, it has almost
 nothing in its favour except ease of use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Some methods are used, not to exterminate all predators from farmlands,
 but simply to decrease their numbers.
 However, such attempts are unlikely to work, unless predator numbers are
 either close to the maximum equilibrium density (K) of the predators or
 close to total extermination of the predators (see Figure

Hunting to reduce carnivore numbers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Many farmers realize that it is impractical to attempt eradication of all
 predators.
 And most farmers prefer not to kill predators at all, if it did not threaten
 their livelihood 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rust_n_Marker_2013a,Rust_2016*"

\end_inset

.
 Instead of trying to eradicate all predators, some farmers still shoot
 predators on sight, just to "keep their numbers down".
 In contrast to the attempts to eradicate predators, usually little extra
 effort or money is spend to actively hunt predators.
 Instead, the farmer simply keeps his rifle with him when driving through
 his farm and shoot any potential predators of livestock that chance to
 cross his path during the day (Francois Kok, 2015, personal communication).
 Many attempts that start off with the aim of eradication, end up as an
 attempt to simply keep predator number down.
 Other methods have also been used to try and reduce predator numbers, like
 denning (killing predator pups with fumigating poisons within their dens)
 or contraception, but these methods are impractical or ineffective for
 most farmers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: This is one of the cheapest methods available to a farmer, on
 average the cost of a single bullet for every predator killed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: It is very seldom that an experienced livestock-killer will
 be killed by this method.
 It is usually young, sub-adult predators who have not yet learned that
 people can be dangerous, who are most likely to be seen and killed.
 Like other lethal methods, it can have the opposite result with an increase
 in livestock predation, instead 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Bailey_n_Conradie_2013,Conradie_n_Piesse_2013"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: This method has very few constraints and can be applied on
 almost any farm.
 There are evidence that at least for some predator species, it can be counter-p
roductive and increase livestock depredation, however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\lang british
Trapping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Whether with the aim of extermination of predators or just reducing predator
 numbers, the costs and effectiveness of trapping is more-or-less the same.
 Different kinds of traps are commonly used, including snares, leg-hold
 traps (gin traps), killer traps (quick kill traps / 
\lang american
cony
\lang british
 bear traps) and cage traps.
 Traps are often used together with fences to catch animals as they move
 through holes in the fence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: Some traps, including most cage traps and some kinds of leg-hold
 traps (soft traps) and even some kind of leg-hold snare traps, can be quite
 selective: while not selective in which animals they catch, when causing
 no permanent injury to the animal caught, a beneficial or non-target species
 can simply be released back into the wild.
 If a specific individual problem predator is responsible for all or most
 livestock depredation, such selection can even be at the individual level.
 The equipment is also fairly inexpensive and normally easy to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: Most traps by themselves are fairly unselective.
 They need to be checked at least once per day in order to prevent the death
 or injury of non-target species.
 Some kinds of traps, like most snares, all killer traps and most gin traps,
 often cause so much injury to the caught animals, that even non-target
 species have to be put down after having been caught.
 These kinds of traps, even if checked regularly, are still unselective.
 Cage traps are totally ineffective against jackals, meaning that their
 use will result in more felid predators being killed, causing a change
 in the ecological equilibrium (balance) that has been formed with a resultant
 increase in both jackals and livestock depredation by jackals.
 Moreover, some species like leopards, react very aggressively to being
 caught in a cage trap and in the process often injure teeth or claws 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Frank_et_al_2003"

\end_inset

.
 This decrease their hunting ability, sometimes forcing them to start killing
 livestock (or even humans - 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Athreya_et_al_2010"

\end_inset

) to survive if they are released again (see section on translocation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "subsec:Translocation"

\end_inset

).
 Like other lethal methods aimed at either the extermination of predators
 or just a decrease in their numbers, the evidence suggest that trapping
 has little long-term effect on livestock depredation levels 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Berger_2006"

\end_inset

 and might even be counter-productive 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Conradie_n_Piesse_2013"

\end_inset

.
 Setting and checking traps is also relatively labour intensive (
\shape italic
cf
\shape default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "McManus_et_al_2014"

\end_inset

) and many farms using this method need at least one labourer permanently
 employed for this purpose (Corrie van der Westhuizen 2016, personal communicati
on).
 If traps are not checked regularly, it leads to the cruel deaths of many
 innocent or beneficial wild animals (up to 80% of the animals caught according
 to a Cape Leopard Trust survey in Namaqualand; Ben-Jon Dreyer 2012, personal
 communication).
 If, as is usual, the trap is set at a hole underneath the fence, once an
 animals has been caught in the trap, predators can move freely through
 that hole (and even scavenge on the animals already caught in the trap),
 making the fence useless for keeping predators away from livestock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: If the farm is very big, or the workforce on the farm very
 small, it might be impossible to check the traps regularly and their use
 becomes unethical.
 Setting traps to catch animals of the right size and without injury, require
 some specialist knowledge.
 For trapping to be really effective in either exterminating predators or
 decreasing livestock depredation, it really needs to be used district-wide
 (with other lethal methods) and are most likely to be effective in transformed
 landscapes with little natural habitat or prey for predators.
 As mentioned, some trapping methods work better against some predators
 while not working against other predator species at all.
 Black-backed jackals specifically, are notorious for being very difficult
 to catch, and avoiding both poison and cage traps.
 Even using leg-hold traps for catching jackals can be a challenge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
By not trying to manipulate predator numbers and allowing them to stabilize
 at equilibrium densities, many preventative methods can be considered as
 more sustainable in the long term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\lang british
Herding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Even before hunting (used since the Dutch came to the Cape), most of the
 indigenous livestock-keeping peoples used herding and kraaling to protect
 their livestock from depredation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Ogada_et_al_2003"

\end_inset

.
 World-wide, herding has traditionally and almost universally included the
 following aspects 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Linnell_et_al_1996"

\end_inset

: By day the animals were allowed to graze as a herd, under the care of
 a herder.
 Livestock were prevented from spreading out, either by the herder or a
 herding dog.
 The herder directed their movement and selected the areas to be grazed
 during the day time.
 At night the flock was rounded up and either herded into a fenced area
 (kraal/corral/boma) or bedded under supervision in an open area where a
 shepherd slept near the flock.
 In most European and middle-Eastern regions large guarding dogs were also
 kept with the flocks by both day and night.
 Overgrazing was avoided by keeping the flocks on the move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: Herding with kraaling, and herding and/or guarding dogs, is
 still one of the most effective methods to prevent livestock depredation.
 Herding dogs can really make life easier for the herder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: With settled farms instead of the nomadic lifestyle of the
 past, the greatest disadvantage of herding when it is combined with kraaling
 (as it almost always is), is the resulting trampling of the veld around
 the kraal.
 Another common objection is that, especially in hot climates, the livestock
 are not able to graze at night.
 Free-ranging livestock will take advantage of the cooler nights, especially
 on moonlit nights, to graze during the night and rest during the heat of
 the day in summer.
 This becomes impossible when herding and kraaling, resulting in an appreciably
 lower meat production (kg/ha), similar to that mentioned by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hansen_2005"

\end_inset

.
 Training of both herders and herding dogs: if using herding dogs, a lot
 of training is needed and it also takes time for a good herder to get to
 know the veld, good grazing areas, predation danger spots and his livestock
 (and dogs) well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: The greatest limitation on using herders, is the difficulty
 of finding reliable herders.
 In Southern Africa, it has traditionally been the job of children, resulting
 in it being a low-paying and low-status job on most farms.
 In an experiment by Conservation South Africa and Cape Leopard Trust in
 Namaqualand with "ecorangers" (specially trained herders who used mobile
 GPS devices with a CyberTracker application to record data on livestock
 movements, depredation losses, predator tracks etc.), out of a group of
 16 who went through a process of selection, interviews and training, at
 the end of the research period only 8 were found to be reliable and doing
 a good job caring for the livestock, and only 5 said that they would consider
 a permanent career as ecoranger in future.
 It was found that one of the best incentives for a herder was owning some
 of the livestock (Corrie van der Westhuizen, Brenda Snyman, 2016 personal
 communication), something that few farmers might be willing to do 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rust_et_al_2016"

\end_inset

.
 Alternatively, costs for herders can be sponsored from outside (e.g.
 the ecoranger project was sponsored in part by the government or the Wildlife
 Guardian program of Defenders of Wildlife mentioned by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp

), but this is unlikely to be sustainable.

Patrolling to scare away predators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
"Range riders" is a method introduced by Defenders of Wildlife in the USA,
 but based on much older principles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Stone_et_al_2008"

\end_inset

.
 Basically it involves using horses to ride through areas where the livestock
 are grazing, seeing what their health and condition are like, and using
 the human activity to scare predators away from the livestock.
 In the USA it is used for extensive farming on open range.
 A similar approach has been used in extensive systems in Norway using a
 range inspector patrolling with a livestock guarding dog (LGD)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hansen_2005"

\end_inset

.
 Because of the resistance by some farmers against kraaling their livestock
 at night, the research project in Namaqualand by the Cape Leopard Trust
 (CLT) and Conservation South Africa (CSA) also used some of their ecorangers
 in the same way to patrol the camp where the livestock were with the dog
 to scare away predators through their presence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: This method is well suited to more extensive farming systems,
 where daily kraaling is not practical.
 In these kind of systems the livestock is seen more frequently and any
 non-predator related problems and general veld condition are also picked
 up earlier than would be otherwise the case.
 Spoor tracking also gives an idea about where the predators spend most
 of their time and from where livestock should be moved for their own safety.
 Where the livestock breeds do not have a strong natural herding instinct
 or are forced to scatter to find enough grazing, this is one of the few
 methods that can still reduce livestock depredation.
 If horses are not used, the costs of this method is about the same as that
 of a herder (and dog), but has the advantage that the dog does not have
 to first bond with the livestock and that the livestock can graze at night
 and thus grow and reproduce better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: Because most predators hunt at night when human presence
 are less likely to have an effect, this method is not very effective.
 Even 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Stone_et_al_2008"

\end_inset

 had to admit that there was no direct proof yet "that range riders actually
 prevented livestock losses from predators".
 Labour is a fast growing cost; rangers that can ride horses plus the necessary
 horse-riding equipment (saddles, bridles etc.) can be quite expensive.

Kraaling at night
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Kraaling involves the practice of having livestock sleep in an enclosure
 (called a kraal, corral, pen, or boma, depending on geographical part of
 the world) at night, when most predators are active.
 These enclosures are usually made predator-proof in some way

, mobile kraals and small log pens for kids or lambs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: Kraaling, combined with herding or guard animals, are often
 the only option where there are high numbers of predators.
 Kraaling can be used on its own with the kraal built around water troughs
 and kept closed while the livestock are out grazing, only opened when they
 are let into the kraal at nightfall.
 When combined with guarding dogs sleeping inside the kraal, it is one of
 the most effective ways for keeping depredation low at night.
 Costs for building kraals can vary between only labour and time for traditional
 thorn bush (high maintenance) and stone kraals (almost no maintenance)
 to US$200.00 - US$900.00 for a chain link fence, an average of US$ 500.00
 for the living wall bomas (almost no maintenance) and about US$2000.00 for
 a mobile kraal

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: The greatest single objection to kraaling, is the trampling
 of the veld that usually happens around the kraal.
 If there are water available in pans or wetlands during the rainy seasons,
 some livestock might also not come to drink water at the kraal and thus
 sleep outside and remain vulnerable to depredation, when kraaling is not
 combined with herding.
 Another important draw-back is the built-up of parasites and outbreaks
 of disease, which are much more likely to happen in the crowded situation
 and repeated use of the same area, typical of kraaling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: Different levels of predator proofing are effective against
 different predators.
 Jackal-proof fences are easy for caracals and leopards to climb and might
 cause very high surplus killing if one of these species get inside the
 kraal.
 Moreover, the kraal obviously has to be strong enough to keep the livestock
 inside as well (e.g.
 fighting bulls or frightened cattle might break out of an enclosure that
 is not strong enough).
 While some of the veld trampling can be avoided by using mobile kraals
 that are moved every now and then, these mobile kraals are often insufficient
 to keep predators out.
 Additionally, with many different flocks in different camps, this method
 can be quite labour-intensive and impractical on large, extensive or mountainou
s farms where reaching the furthest camps can take many hours.

 A totally predator-proof fence is possible, but very expensive, and only
 really economically viable for small breeding camps of high-value game
 species, like sable and roan (W.P.
 Barnard 2015, personal communication).
 Predators are not killed by the fence itself, but by constricting the movement
 of predators within the camp and clearing the camps from predators one
 by one using other methods, it can result in an almost total eradication
 of the predators in a whole district.

Disadvantages: Putting up predator-proof fencing, especially without any
 government subsidies, is very expensive.
 Predator-proof fencing do not only stop predators, but also most other
 wildlife from freely moving around.
 This has a negative effect on the overall biodiversity of the veld and
 its long-term sustainability.
 Because digging animals like warthogs and aardvarks often dig underneath
 fences, it is important to regularly patrol and maintain all fences, if
 the fences are to be effective at all.
 This can be quite expensive and labour-intensive and with the typical increase
 in labour costs, no government subsidising and low profit margins of livestock
 farming, makes it more expensive and less effective than alternatives.
 Once the predator is inside the camp it can kill prey (including livestock)
 easier by cornering them against the fence, often leading to surplus killing.
 This is a disadvantage of all kinds of fences, including kraals.

Limitations: Truly predator-proof fencing is not possible in some kinds

 Jackal-proof fencing, while relatively effective against jackals, are not

 The high costs of proper predator-proof fencing, the age and state of disrepair
 of current fences, the lack of government subsidies, and the lack of district-w
ide cooperation makes it increasingly impractical for your typical livestock
 farmer.
 The increase in "week-end" farmers with less time to spend on maintenance,
 makes any district-wide attempts at predator eradication impractical.

Electric fencing can be used either as a kind of predator-proof fencing
 or as mobile, temporary fencing, primarily for livestock (usually as part
 of holistic short-duration high-intensity grazing systems).
 For mobile electronic fences, a single strand is often used to keep the
 livestock together and while it might not keep the predators out, by keeping
 the livestock together, it effectively causes the livestock to use other
 methods against predators (like cattle protecting small livestock and keeping
 livestock bunched together for protection).

Advantages: Electric fences can keep out predators like caracals and leopards

 It can also prevent digging animals like aardvark or warthogs from making
 openings below the fences that predators can use to move through.
 Mobile electric fencing can be used as a management tool for short-duration,
 high-intensity grazing systems ("holistic grazing") without being nearly
 as labour-intensive as normal herding.
 It can be a very effective method to keep predators away from a relatively
 small area.

 Fladry, while cheaper than the other options, is also maintenance-intensive.
 The Jakkalsjaer repellents also only have a limited range (about 150 ha
 per unit) and while livestock in a camp that is close to it might be save,
 others that are further away in a camp, might still be vulnerable (or multiple
 devices per camp might be needed).
 Moreover, sometimes the lights and sounds attract thieves who steal not
 only the livestock, but also the expensive equipment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 Most predators are territorial.
 If there are repellents in all of its territory, hunger will force the
 predator to habituate to the repellents eventually.
 Therefore it is important that the predators have "sanctuaries" without
 any livestock and where they can survive on wild prey, for this method
 to be effective.

 They vary greatly in price and effectiveness, but they all contribute to
 the ability of predators to distinguish between natural prey and livestock
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 The e-shepherd is a system where the collar gives an ultrasound alarm and
 shine LED lights as soon as the sheep starts running (being chased by a
 predators) or leave a certain area.
 Another high-tech type collar is the GSM based "Veldwagter" system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: For the high-tech versions which only gives an alarm when the
 livestock are being attacked, it takes longer for the predators to get
 used to them.
 Preliminary testing of the E-Shepherd collars have shown them to be effective
 for at least a year.
 This implies that while predators might eventually get used to them, they
 are effective for longer periods than the static repellents.
 They can also be used together with other methods (e.g.
 livestock guarding dogs with bell collars) to warn predators away.
 The "Veldwagter" system has also helped to prevent stock theft 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Smuts_2008"

\end_inset

, another major source of livestock losses in parts of Southern Africa.
 In the best case so far, it has reduced livestock losses from 320 sheep
 per year down to 12 sheep per year.
 It appears to be a good choice for farms close to towns where cell phone
 coverage is better and the more likely causes of livestock loss are theft
 and domestic feral dogs.
 Bell collars work well together with herders and LEDs, both in warning
 the predator that livestock are not natural prey, and in helping the herder
 to locate and keep the herd together 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Begg_n_Kushnir_2013"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantage: Once predators have habituated to the repellent, it can have
 exactly the opposite effect of calling the predator to dinner, rather than
 warning the predator off.
 And predators learn from each other, so this behaviour might spread quite
 quickly within the predator population once a single predator has figured
 out that the collars are actually harmless.
 The high-tech versions of the collars are quite expensive.
 The E-shepherd collars costing about the same as a fully-grown sheep (N$
 1200.00 in the beginning of 2016 - E-Shepherd, personal communication).
 It is recommended that at least one collar per every 10 sheep be used,
 meaning that depredation losses must be very high before it begins to make
 economic sense.
 The "Veldwagter"system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Smuts_2008"

\end_inset

 uses the cell phone network to warn the farmer of any unusual movement
 of sheep.
 It costs almost N$ 5000.00 per collar (in 2008) and therefore only one collar
 per herd is recommended, meaning that if the herd breaks up into smaller
 groups (like Dorper sheep and many European breeds), it might no longer
 be effective.
 Like any other collaring system, this method is quite labour-intensive,
 especially when collars are using on growing lambs or kids (the most vulnerable
 individuals), since the collars have to be checked and adjusted every couple
 of weeks.
 In extensive farming systems where livestock are not seen regularly, the
 collar might start to strangle growing sub-adults (Charles Schreuder 2011,
 personal communication).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: All these methods will only be effective in the long run if
 there is enough wild prey available to the predators as an alternative
 food source (or the neighbour's livestock when he is doing less to protect
 his livestock).
 If there is no other option, hunger will force the predator to attack livestock
 in spite of the repellent collars.
 The high cost versions are only an option in cases of very high livestock
 depredation rates, while the low cost versions are only effective (if at
 all) in combination with other methods.
 It is also not a good option for extensive farming systems which aim to
 be less labour intensive.
 Some systems (e.g.
 the Veldwagter collars) require cell phone coverage to work, making it
 impractical for large parts of Namibia.

 A number of factors make this method impractical...
 Unless a single animal is causing all the damage and it is being used as
 reactive method, this method cannot be used.
 It can help to keep the predator away from a certain area, but will not
 prevent the predator from killing livestock elsewhere.
 All vulnerable livestock therefore need to be kept inside the "protected"
 area that will cause the collar to shock the predator.
 The period of effectiveness will be restricted pretty much to the shock
 collar's battery life.
 The difficulty in capturing the right individual causing the livestock
 depredation plus the collaring cost, limits it usefulness further.
 It will thus not be discussed further here.

Protective livestock collars
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
In contrast to poison collars (a reactive measure) where the livestock animal
 with the collar is sacrificed in the process, these collars attempt to
 prevent the predator from killing livestock.
 It also differs from the repellent types of collars by not primarily trying
 to change the predator behaviour, but to make actual attacks less effective,
 instead.
 Most predators attack the neck or throat to kill livestock.
 These kind of collars thus aim to prevent a predator attack from succeeding
 in killing the livestock animal, but also hope to change predator behaviour
 to avoid livestock and revert to natural prey instead.
 The most commonly available versions in Southern Africa, are the KingCollar
 (a broad, 1 mm thick, semi-rigid, high-density polyethylene collar that
 are attached to the entire flock of livestock) and the Dead Stop Collars
 (consisting of a broad metal mesh, which is epoxy-coated), both described

 (cost: N$ 5.00-6.00 depending on size in 2008) can kill livestock by strangulatio
n if not checked and adjusted regularly on growing livestock (Charles Schreuder
 2011, personal communication).
 It is thus fairly labour intensive.
 To be truly effective, every single vulnerable livestock animals needs
 to be collared, since the aim of this method is not primarily to change
 predator behaviour.
 However, it can have a negative backlash when some predators (especially
 jackals) start to attack livestock from behind by ripping them apart and
 avoiding the neck or throat when attacking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Limitations: The greatest limitation of these collars are that applying
 them can be fairly labour-intensive.

 As long as the territorial predators with a developed taste aversion stay

 Moreover, it does not work overnight, so farmers might loose a number of

 Misapplication is not neutral in the sense that it can actually increase
 depredation losses if done wrongly, e.g.
 if the predator learn to taste the chemical and start killing livestock

 it is incompatible with any method that involves predator removal

Livestock guarding dogs (LEDs)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Livestock guarding dogs are already mentioned in one of the oldest books
 in the Bible (Job 30:1).
 Livestock guarding dogs should be clearly distinguished from herding dogs.
 Whereas herding dogs use behaviour similar to that of a predator to scare
 and bunch livestock together and move them in the direction they want,
 livestock guarding dogs behave as one of the flock.
 They are bred to be trustworthy (will not harm the flock), attentive (stays
 with the flock), and protective (barks and defends the flock).
 One of the best adapted breeds to the Namibian climate, long distances
 and large enough for its predator species, is the Anatolian/Kangal, although
 Rhodesian Ridgebacks have also been used with success (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp

\end_inset

).
 While there are many other breeds of livestock guarding dogs that are protectiv
e, attentive and trustworthy, most of them were bred for different climates
 and are not a good fit for the heat and long daily livestock movements
 of Namibia.
 LEDs are used in different ways.
 The traditional way and the most effective 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hansen_2005"

\end_inset

, is the use of dogs together with herders and kraaling at night.
 But they have also been used in other ways, some of which are better suited
 to extensive farming conditions: the cheapest method (and the second most
 effective) is having LEDs alone in camps with livestock.
 Two other options is having LEDs alone with livestock in open range 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 or patrolling the livestock together with a "range inspector"

Advantages: Well-trained livestock guarding dogs are one the best protectors
 of livestock against predators 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Marker_et_al_2005a"

\end_inset

.
 Compared to herders, they are also relatively cheap (the cost of the puppy
 plus about N$500.00/month for food and veterinary costs = cost of 5-6 small
 livestock units saved per year).
 Once the dog and livestock have bonded, self-feeders can be used to feed
 them and a minimum of effort and labour is required for maintaining the
 protection of livestock (Ivan van Niekerk 2016, personal communication).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: It takes about a year for an Anatolian shepherd dog to be
 trained and develop enough confidence to chase away a large predator like
 a leopard or cheetahs.
 Therefore in the first year of its life, a livestock guarding dog needs
 to be accompanied by a herder in order to teach it not to chase game, play
 with the young livestock or learn other behavioural problems.
 Of course, the herd itself also needs to be protected until the LGD can
 take its place.
 For this reason, the first year of the dog's training can be quite expensive.
 On average a LGD has a working lifetime of about 4-5 years in Namibia and
 sometimes a dog can die from snake bite within its first year of working
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Marker_et_al_2005"

\end_inset

.
 However, since snakebite have been the major cause of death, snake aversion
 training might extend the average working life of LEDs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rust_et_al_2013"

\end_inset

.
 This means that a new dog needs to be trained on average every 5 year just
 to protect the same number of livestock.
 If a LGD is not trained properly, it can show all kinds of behavioural
 problems, including at worst, starting to kill livestock itself.
 Therefore the herder doing the training needs both to know how to train
 the dog and be trustworthy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Schumann_Ed_2004,Potgieter_2011"

\end_inset

.
 Another major drawback to using LGDs, is that the demand is much higher
 than the supply, so a farmer might not always be able get a dog when required.
 Although self-feeders can ease the problem, regular care of the dog is
 still a requirement making the utilization of remote areas by livestock
 problematic.
 Sometimes the most vulnerable livestock is no longer in the herd to which
 the LGD has bonded and a whole process is involved to introduce the dog
 to its new herd.
 This method can thus cause a lot more management headaches compared to
 other methods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: One LGD can protect no more than 200 small livestock effectively.
 This will also depend on the vegetation, terrain and the predator threat
 itself.
 Because the dogs bond with a specific herd, when two herds each with their
 own LGD are put into adjacent camps, the dog might attack each other, attack
 the livestock of the neighbouring camp or even start to spend time with
 each other and start ignoring the livestock.
 LEDs have not been tested with cattle, but it will probably be quite difficult
 to bond the dog with cattle, since most cows will tend to be quite aggressive
 in protecting their calves and can easily kill the puppy.
 So while it might be possible, bonding cattle and dogs has not yet been
 tested.
 Not only does the dog need to bond with the livestock herd, but the herd
 also needs to bond with the dog.
 When this does not happen properly, some sheep will run away from the dog
 and can even break legs or kill themselves while running away from the
 dog, especially in mountainous terrain (personal observation).
 The dog is also limited to work only with the kind of livestock to which
 it is bonded, meaning that a dog that was raised with goats cannot be used
 with sheep, nor a dog raised with sheep used with goats.

Guard donkeys

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Donkeys are one of the undervalued protection animals against predators.
 While they cannot protect against some of the same size predators that
 LEDs can, they do not require special feeding, as they graze with the other
 livestock and are much easier and cheaper to acquire 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Linnell_et_al_1996"

\end_inset

.
 The principle behind this method is to use the protective instinct of a
 donkey for her foal to also protect other livestock.
 Normally a female donkey that has recently foaled is put with her foal
 among livestock about to calf.
 Since she would not like to be alone, she tends to stay with the livestock
 and chase away any predators that threaten the young.
 To be successfully implemented, there are a number of guidelines to keep
 in mind: 1) use only a mare or gelding since donkey stallions can be aggressive
 to livestock; 2) have the donkey bond with the herd it is to protect for
 4-6 weeks; 3) use only one donkey per herd, (or a single jenny with a foal),
 otherwise a group of donkey will rather graze on their own; 4) test a new
 donkey’s response to predators (use a dog in a kraal with the donkey and
 do not use donkeys that react passively); and 5) use donkeys in small open
 pastures with a moderate-size herd

 Females normally don't move very far once they have small young, thus creating
 a temporary depredation hotspot around their denning sites, to be avoided
 by vulnerable livestock.
 For the smaller meso-predators, like jackals and caracals, little is known
 about their habitat preferences in general and their preferred hunting
 habitat in particular.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: Where livestock are kept in camps, like almost all commercial
 farms in Namibia, it is a very easy to implement method, costing almost
 nothing except planning.
 Because of a minimum interference with the ecology and behaviour of predators,
 this method "works with nature" and is one of the more sustainable methods.
 It can also be combined with most other methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: This method is dependent on the veld of a farm providing
 heterogeneous habitat with different hunting preferences by predators.
 If all of the farm consists of "difficult terrain", as sometimes happens,
 it cannot be implemented.
 This might be one reason for the often reported differences in livestock
 depredation rates, being very high on some farms while many of the other
 farms in a district have negligible losses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 livestock losses in some areas of the farm.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
While the previous method depend on spatial avoidance of predators, this
 method depends on temporal avoidance.
 By having specific calving/lambing seasons, the same strategy used by many
 natural prey species is mimicked.
 By not providing the predators with a ready source of food throughout the
 year, an increase in predator densities is avoided.
 Any of the other preventative methods could also be used for a short period
 in those seasons when livestock are most vulnerable (e.g.
 when there are young animals).
 Such seasonal changes will need to take into account both the seasonal
 behaviour of the predators (e.g.
 breeding seasons etc.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Shivik_2004"

\end_inset

) and the seasonal grazing requirements of the livestock.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Linnell_et_al_1996"

\end_inset

 summarize this method as using 1) seasonal changes in livestock husbandry
 practices, 2) seasonal changes in the life cycle of livestock (birth seasons),
 3) seasonal changes in predator life cycles, 4) seasonal changes in the
 availability of alternative prey and 5) seasonal changes in predation levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: If the birth season is synchronized with that of preferred wild
 prey species, it can drastically reduce livestock losses compared to livestock
 giving birth throughout the year.
 Alternatively, if the predator species on a farm have a distinct breeding
 season (e.g.
 black-backed jackals in springtime) during which they would have utilized
 the birthing season of their natural prey in the wild to feed their young,
 avoiding this season for the birth of livestock can make a big difference
 on livestock depredation losses.
 Many livestock species have a natural breeding season in any case and manipulat
ing this a bit is easy and cheap.
 This method can also be combined with many other methods and is almost
 required for some other methods to work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: There is a reason why natural prey species have their young
 in a specific season (when they have seasonal breeding)...
 it is usually the season with the best veld for raising young.
 This is also true for livestock.
 So changing the birth season to avoid predators might result in losses
 due to unsuitable veld conditions.
 Having distinct breeding seasons requires more direct management of the
 livestock and possibly higher labour costs.
 One of the greatest drawbacks is that it might result in lower birth percentage
s for livestock, especially in extensive farming systems where the males
 might simply not get to all the receptive females in time for those livestock
 species who are not naturally seasonal breeders, while year-round breeding
 increases the chance of higher birth percentages in extensive farming systems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: Where livestock depredation do not have seasonal peaks or does
 not happen primarily to feed predator young, this method is impractical.
 When aiming for a birth season to coincide with an increased availability
 of natural prey, this method is only practical where enough wild prey is
 available on the farm.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: In addition to making it easier to protect livestock from predators,
 having small camps close to the homestead, makes more intensive livestock

 The increase in survival of young might compensate for any decrease in

 Where irrigated pastures are possible, it can actually lead to an increase
 in production compared to more extensive free-range systems.
 This method can also be combined with various other methods.

\lang british
Limitations: The availability of enough good grazing around the homestead
 for all female and young (if calving/lambing seasons are used) or throughout

Kraaling young livestock full-time 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
In contrast to kraaling of all livestock at night, this involves keeping
 the young animals in a predator-proof enclosure permanently, with the adult
 females joining their young to suckle only at night while grazing during
 the day.
 Or alternatively (especially in the hot summer-time), having the adults
 graze at night and suckling their young during the day.
 This has been a traditional livestock management technique in Northern
 Namibia (Francois Kok, Johann Britz 2013, personal communication; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Marker_et_al_1996"

).
 A variation on this method would be to kraal all livestock full-time in
 a feeding lot.
 However, this has been found as not economically viable in Namibia 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

, mostly because of high prices for livestock feed and long distances to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: For cattle this method has been shown to be quite effective
 in North Central Namibia.
 In some situations, with high livestock depredation levels, it might be
 one of the few solutions available.
 For natural "hiders", like goats (and cattle to some extent), where the
 young is not strong enough to keep up with the adults and would normally
 remain hidden in one place, while their mothers graze (in contrast to "follower

 the herd, like sheep; 
\shape italic

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

), this method combines well with intensive care of the young by the farmer.
 While the young in this method might initially grow slower than free-ranging
 young who are with their mothers all the time, they often make up for the
 difference by weaning age already.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: This method is fairly labour-intensive (and thus costly).
 For each camp or cattle post with cows, a reliable worker is needed to
 let the adult cows out, while keeping the calves inside every day, 7 days
 a week.
 To be at all practical, it has to be combined with birthing seasons.
 If a single central kraal is used, the same issues with trampling of the
 veld and weaker growth and production starts to play a role.
 Some farmers also complain that this method result in weaker protective
 and mothering instincts in the cows when the calves are finally allowed
 to go out and graze with their mothers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: This is not a practical solution for extensive farming systems

Changing breed or species of livestock
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Where predation levels are very high, the best option for the farmer might
 be to change to other breeds or species of livestock.
 Cattle are in general less susceptible to depredation than small livestock.
 In mountainous areas, goats can experience less depredation than sheep
 (especially less surplus killing events).
 Behavioural attributes of different breeds can influence depredation in
 two ways 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Linnell_et_al_1996"

\end_inset

: 1) through behavioural traits making other management methods easier (e.g.
 making herding easier) or 2) through specific anti-predator behaviour (e.g.
 aggressive attacks of predators).
 Simple size might put livestock out of the preferred prey size range of
 some predators (e.g.
 cattle are not generally vulnerable to caracals).
 Damara and karakul sheep breeds are known to bunch together more in larger
 herds than breeds like dorpers.
 Sheep natural behaviour actually varies all the way from large grazing-while-mo
ving herds, adapted better for lower grass cover, to more selective, more
 sedentary grazers, in smaller groups to sheep breeds that form territorial
 breeding pairs.
 Some breeds of European (

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Stone_et_al_2008"

\end_inset

.
 Cattle that know the kind of terrain on a farm (e.g.
 mountain-raised cattle) also tend to suffer less depredation losses than
 cattle from other areas.
 Generally, horned cattle breeds are likely to be able to better protect
 their calves than polled or short-horn breeds, but individual cows also
 differ in their protectiveness.
 Goats tend to scatter uphill when attacked by predators, leading to less
 surplus killing, unlike sheep that tend to mill around in one place (but
 sometimes defend their lambs better in the herd against smaller predators).
 Angora goats are also much more vulnerable to predation than Boer goats.
 There are unconfirmed claims by some farmers that by not weaning their
 female Damara lambs, it allows the mothers to teach their daughters how
 to protect their lambs and also help to establish a herd hierarchy, leading
 to less depredations losses to jackals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: This method is simple and fairly easy to implement.
 However, in some cases it can have limited success in reducing livestock
 depredation unless combined with other methods.

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: The switch to other livestock species or breed can have negative
 economic consequences (e.g.
 beef is generally significantly cheaper than mutton and cattle has a much
 lower rate of increase than either sheep or goats).
 Because few farmers can afford to make such a switch quickly, any change
 has to be done slowly, leading to continued losses until the switch has
 been completed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: Dairy breeds are generally not well-adapted to the hot climate,
 thorny vegetation and long distances required to walk between grazing and
 drinking water typical of many parts of Namibia.
 Cattle are tall grass grazers, using their tongues to ingest grass, making
 a switch to cattle not an option in areas dominated by short grasses where
 tall grass grazers did not occur naturally.
 Additionally, for a stud farm where the stud might have built up over generatio
ns, switching to a different breed is both financially and emotionally not
 a realistic option (Harry Schneider-Waterberg 2013, personal communication).

Some farmers in Namibia use a steer production farming system whereby they
 buy weaner calves and then graze the steers and heifers on natural grazing

 By weaning age, most calves are no longer vulnerable to many predators
 and depredation losses can be minimal in this kind of farming system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: Especially when there are few predators larger then cheetahs
 on the farm, this method can be very effective.
 It is fairly easy to implement, although it needs careful record keeping

 One major advantage is that with this method it is easier to quickly adapt
 stocking rates according to the rainfall (i.e.
 buy fewer new cattle when the veld condition is becoming bad).

Horned cattle

 Putting experienced bulls, horned oxen and old cows with young animals

 predators is a simple way to allow livestock to use their natural instincts
 and behaviour for reducing depredation losses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: This is one of the easiest methods when farming with horned
 livestock breeds, since it actually involves less labour and thus labour
 costs than the alternative of de-horning.
 It is also very easy to implement in extensive farming systems.
 When combined with strong behavioural breeding selection for those cows
 who are able to protect their young from predators, this can be a very
 cost-effective method to reduce livestock depredation, with higher wean
 percentages compensating for all of the potential drawbacks.
 Together with choosing the right kind and breed of livestock, this might
 be one of the only methods available to very extensive farming systems

, it mimics another natural strategy used by many prey species to minimize
 depredation by crowding together for protection.
 Instead of having many small herds of livestock distributed through the
 landscape, having a single large herd (or only a few large herds) means
 both the chances of a predator encounter is smaller and that the herd is
 more able to protect its vulnerable members 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: Holistic grazing systems can result in improvement of the range-land

 systems like normal rotational grazing or adaptive grazing regimes (e.g.
 short period - at most 2 weeks - selective grazing early in the growing
 season, followed by long periods of grazing all grasses down after the
 grasses had seeded) has not been demonstrated where trampling will not
 result in a vegetative ground litter cover of the veld, simply due to too
 little vegetation available.
 In general, because livestock is forced not to graze selectively for more
 nutritious grasses, this method, while improving the veld in the long run,
 can cause lower production by livestock in the short term.
 General livestock management (e.g.
 vaccinations or early detection of any health issues) can be more difficult

 One example of such a method that really worked well for wildlife in general
 (although not directly applicable to carnivores), was when Namibian legislation
 changed in 1967 so that all non-protected wildlife on a farm became the
 property of the land-owner.
 Before this, all wildlife belonged to the government and were generally
 considered as a nuisance by farmers who tried to rid their farms of these
 competitors with their livestock for grazing.
 This change caused wildlife to suddenly become a valuable resource for
 sustainable use of game animals for biltong and meat, resulting in an estimated
 70% increase in game numbers and 44% increase in species diversity on farmlands

 They distinguish between 3 types of PEC: 1) compensation and insurance

 "An “ideal” PEC would: (i) minimize conflict by specifically targeting
 payments to those most directly affected by carnivores, (ii) reduce the
 direct costs of human–carnivore coexistence, (iii) provide local people
 with additional revenue directly linked to carnivores, (iv) avoid moral
 hazard and perverse incentives, (v) not require significant additional
 external revenue, (vi) specifically link payments to desired conservation
 outcomes, and (vii) be likely to have a positive impact on human poverty."
 Most of these aims have seldom, if ever been reached in actual compensation

 methods is that the conflict is an economic issue.
 In reality, most farmers have a sense of responsibility towards the livestock

 She also mentions the difference between typically utilitarian, rural view
 of wildlife and the typically recreational, urban view of wildlife.
 The political momentum and support for carnivore restoration and conservation
 largely comes from urbanized centres that neither live in the area of carnivore
s nor shares the livestock producing way of life.
 This illustrates why the conflict is often considered as primarily between

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: The greatest constraint on the use of trophy hunting of predators
 to help farmers become more positive about predators on their land, is
 that predators are on the top of the food chain.
 This means that a single predator can often use more than one farm as part
 of its home range and that a single farm with the available natural prey
 and habitat on it can often support only relatively few predators (compared
 to herbivores).
 Unless the income from a single trophy predator shot every few years surpasses
 the livestock losses due to those predators living on the land, it will
 not act as an incentive for farmers to sustain predator populations on
 their land.
 In this case trophy hunting of a predator will at best offset some of the

 with predators and to encourage it by paying them in part or fully for
 livestock losses due to predators.
 There can be three sources of funding for the payments, 1) government,
 2) hunters' associations or 3) private conservation organizations

 Paying below market value of losses are often done to prevent perverse

 livestock to market, resulting in farmers not expending any effort to prevent
 livestock losses and sometimes even claiming for non-predation livestock

One of the few reported cases where such compensation appears sustainable
 and effective, involved a WWF funded project for Central Asian leopards
 in Turkmenistan 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lukarevsky_2003"

\end_inset

.
 However, it had a number of unique features: 1) The team included members
 of the local community, including the leader himself.
 It was thus not a case of "outsiders" running the project.
 2) Local residents actively participated in planning a strategy for leopard
 conservation.
 3) Instead of money or other means of compensation, it was decided to compensat
e farmers in kind (i.e.
 with other livestock to replace any livestock killed by a leopard).
 4) Using the funding money from WWF a herd of sheep was bought, from which
 the offspring would be used to give compensation for depredation losses.
 5) The herd became the property of the local-based Catena Ecoclub, enabling
 them to make decisions with regards to how the flock would be organized,
 how cases of leopard attacks would be analysed, etc.
 6) Because the livestock herd can reproduce and was not used for any other
 purpose, this ensured the sustainability of the original WWF funding.
 A flock of 650-700 sheep would grow on its own and cover the cost of paying
 shepherds and veterinarians.
 7) Next, 40 of the most influential and respected ranchers were invited
 to participate in a seminar where the project was explained to them.
 A council was elected to look after the herd on an annual basis and it
 was decided that the livestock would eventually become the property of
 the local farmers association once it was established.
 8) This local council elected 2 experts to investigate cases of supposed
 leopard kills.
 9) A simple procedure was established by which a farmer would register
 a case of livestock losses, and the experts would not only decide whether
 it was truly a leopard kill, but also whether the farmer's livestock were
 properly managed to prevent predation.
 10) The local communities were kept up to date about the progress of the
 project using poster display stands and education.
 The long-term plan was to combine education and compensation to ensure
 the survival of Central Asian leopards.
 Perhaps the most important lesson from this case study was the role of
 local leadership in all phases of the project, ensuring that the long-term
 beneficiaries and implementers of the project were also involved in the
 decision-making process and the resulting project was well-adapted to local
 conditions (see also

 This method basically shares the same strengths and weaknesses of direct

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

), insurance might be an affordable and sustainable way to compensate for
 livestock losses.
 It can make the compensation independent and provide something that farmers
 can mostly do for themselves, instead of having to rely on outside funding
 organizations or government like other compensation schemes.
 This method can provide farmers with some peace of mind and works well
 with almost any other method.
 Where insurance is working well (i.e.
 sustainable), payment of rewards for those farmers with the least number
 of livestock losses to predators (least number of claims), can be an added
 incentive for good livestock husbandry practices, combining insurance with
 preventative methods (e.g.

This is one of the few compensation methods where successes have been recorded
 (e.g.

\end_inset

).
 Instead of directly paying farmers, paying price premiums for their produce
 (e.g.
 the "Wildlife Friendly Meat" project by Conservation South Africa in Namaqualan
d, South Africa) is an alternative method to compensate formers for coexisting
 with predators on their land.
 Instead of paying for losses of livestock to predators, the meat from farms
 who followed certain management practices were to be branded as "Wildlife
 Friendly", sold in Woolworths stores for higher than normal prices with
 the price premium being passed on to the farmers.
 Such niche marketing basically depends on changing the level of predation
 loss that is economically (and socially) acceptable to farmers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

Advantages: Unstable markets and fluctuations in the prices of livestock
 products is a major issue for all commercial farmers.
 A price premium is one important way to help farmers manage the risk of
 coexisting with predators on there land instead of aiming for extirpation
 of all predators.
 Trough rewarding livestock farmers directly for conserving predators on
 their land, the real aim of these kind of compensation schemes is directly
 addressed (instead of a roundabout way of partial compensation for economic
 losses only).
 The farmers protecting their livestock well using preventative methods,
 still score by having greater livestock survival rates; i.e.
 there is no danger for perverse incentive to allow livestock depredation
 in order to be compensated (

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: Unless such a compensation scheme is adapted well to the
 local situation (e.g.
 by including local agricultural leaders in the planning and decision-making
 process), lack of participation by farmers might make it useless.
 Because many of the threatened predators have home ranges that overlap
 with more than one farm, a single farmer or even a few dispersed farmers,
 might not contribute much to the long-term survival of predator species.
 Finding shops that are willing to sell predator-friendly livestock products
 as a separate brand and are moreover willing to pass the premium price
 on to the farmers, is difficult.
 Similar efforts in Namibia to market and sell "cheetah-friendly meat" in
 the past fell apart because 1) it was difficult to ensure farmers' compliance
 with the required management practices and 2) separate branding and marketing
 (and passing higher prices on to the producers) was an issue for the supply
 chain (L.L.
 Marker 2013, personal communication).
 There was and still is uncertainty on whether the demand for such products
 is high enough to sustain a higher price.
 Consumers might support the idea of "predator-friendly" meat production,
 but are they actually willing to pay more for such meat? Woolworths, as
 a franchise that targets the upmarket section of consumers, might be considered
 as the ideal partner in such a project, but up to the present higher producer
 prices have still failed to realize in practice.
 Like in the case of compensation for livestock losses, the numbers of predators
 on a farm now have to be confirmed before payment is possible

Reactive methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Reactive methods have the advantage that unless there are real losses to
 predators, nothing or little needs to be done.
 As long as there is little livestock depredation, the implementation costs
 are also low.
 Of course, it can always be combined with other methods.
 The greatest disadvantage of these methods is that they usually do not
 prevent any livestock losses and the farmer might experience significant
 losses before implementing a reactive method.
 For this reason, these methods are generally better for situations where
 livestock losses are infrequent and not useful at all for areas where depredati
on of livestock is common.
 The main aim of reactive methods is thus to prevent further losses, after
 a predator already attacked livestock.

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
In contrast to the preventative use of hunting to eradicate predators or
 decrease predator numbers, hunting (with or without dogs) can also be used
 reactively.
 In this case the main aim is to kill the specific individual that was responsib

 Even if the method does not result in any actual decrease in livestock
 depredation, it does give the farmer some intrinsic satisfaction to kill
 the guilty predator

.
 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Chapron_n_Treves_2016"

\end_inset

 showed that allowing killing of predators or government culling of predators
 did not make livestock owners more positive towards predators, but actually
 increased illegal killing of predators.
 An important assumption, and one that has been challenged (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Linnell_et_al_1999"

\end_inset

) is that there are specific individuals that become livestock killers or
 "problem animals".
 For some species (e.g.
 coyotes - 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Sacks_et_al_1999,Jaeger_2004"

\end_inset

) it is fairly clear that a few individual animals are responsible for most
 of the livestock depredation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Stander_1990b"

\end_inset

, while the majority of the predators prefer natural prey, but for other
 species it appears as if predators simply utilize livestock within the
 right size range according to their availability, making little differentiation
 between livestock and other prey species.
 In the latter case, removing any individual animal will simply result in
 its place been taken be another individual who will continue to prey on
 livestock, at most giving a short reprieve in livestock losses, while having
 a destabilising effect on the ecosystem (and its sustainability).
 It has long been known that removal of a single predator can sometimes
 temporarily stop any further livestock losses.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jaeger_2004"

 showed that in coyotes (which have similar behaviour to black-backed jackals,
 see also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Estes_1991,Ferguson_et_al_1983"

\end_inset

) it is principally the resident alpha breeding pair that are killing livestock
 and removing them will stop livestock killing until a new alpha pair is
 established three to four months later.
 Indiscriminate killing of coyotes had no effect on livestock losses at
 all, mostly because the betas and transient individuals were much more
 vulnerable to capture than the alphas.
 However, they did not investigate what the effect will be a year later,
 and the 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Conradie_n_Piesse_2013"

\end_inset

 study showed that it could increase livestock losses in the next year.
 Two possible ecological explanations for such an increase could be that
 the neighbouring alpha pairs expand their territories so that the territory
 which used to have one territorial breeding pair is now shared by 6 or
 more breeding pairs.
 Alternatively, the betas might start breeding in the next year since there
 is no alpha pair to suppress their breeding.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Balme_et_al_2009a"

\end_inset

 suggested the following procedure to ensure that only habitual livestock
 killing leopards were removed: 1) inspect depredation events within 24
 h of being reported; 2) if a leopard is verified as being responsible for
 the damage, an attempt is made to identify the individual by deploying
 camera-traps at the kill site; 3) a destruction permit is granted only
 when the same leopard is known to be responsible for at least three depredation
 events within a 2-month period.
 A similar method has been used occasionally in Namibia, but using a GPS
 collar on the suspect leopards, instead of camera traps (Stuart Munro 2015,
 personal communication).

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Advantages: Since it is only used after livestock had been killed, it can
 be substantially less expensive than pre-emptive hunting.
 Especially if dogs are used to take the trail from where livestock have
 been killed, this method can be very selective in order to kill the specific
 individual that was responsible for killing livestock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Disadvantages: If the guilty predator was not a habitual livestock killer,
 removing it might have no effect at all on the livestock losses.
 In the case study from the Ceres Karoo hunting club 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Conradie_n_Piesse_2013"

\end_inset

, predators were mostly killed in response to livestock losses.
 And yet, the result was that those farms where most predators were killed
 in a certain year, had an increase in livestock depredation in the following
 year (however, there is little indication that this killing was very selective).
 This method might therefore not be very effective.
 It is actually quite difficult to be certain that the specific individual
 who had killed livestock, is being targeted.
 Moreover, there has been recorded instances where an individual collared
 male leopard that killed many livestock in a single night, on two neighbouring
 farms, afterwards walked past within 50 m of the same livestock kraal,
 without ever killing a single livestock animal again over a period of 6
 years (Quinton Martins 2010, personal communication).
 Removing the predator might thus have no effect on future livestock losses
 at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang british
Limitations: Being selective and finding the guilty predator is very dependent
 on any livestock depredation events being found shortly after the kill.
 If the livestock are spread wide over a big farm or the labour force on

 predator has become a specialist killer of livestock.
 As shown by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 who are simply in the wrong place (i.e.
 hunting in a habitat where there are lots of livestock) or those who actually
 start to specialize in killing livestock.
 In the former case, the territorial animal who was responsible for livestock
 losses will simply be replaced by one or more others who will continue
 killing livestock.
 Various studies have shown that predators, especially felids, often move
 great distances after having been relocated, and either resume killing
 livestock somewhere else or return to their original home range (and sometimes
 continue killing livestock there)

 Additionally, if it is moved into an area with high densities of con-specifics,
 a territorial predator will either have to replace the current inhabitants
 of the territory (followed by SSI in males), be killed by a current territorial
 individual, or have to move out and find an empty space for itself, often
 on farmlands again.
 Relocating some species over long distances can compromise their genetic
 integrity

 The second constraint was that lion prides had to be either relocated to
 their original territories within protected areas, or moved to areas where

 The same principles might be true for some other predator species.
 However, this necessitates that enough is known about both the animals

 However, the model will differ between countries and species.

 happen over distances larger than 200km, to a conservation area (or land-use
 without conflict potential) of at least 875 km², with current low resident
 leopard densities (<2 leopards/100 km²) and with releases at least 18 months
 apart to mimic natural dispersion events of sub-adult leopards.
 Although having a data point of one female only, a soft release method
 appeared to result in less movement post-release.
 The model had a 67% to 83% success rate (depending on how success was defined),
 but they still did not recommend it as a standard response to carnivore
 conflict, since there are only a limited number of places in Namibia left

 of view, is the use of collars on livestock with poison pockets around
 the throat of the sheep

Advantages: This is the only use of poison that are selective in killing
 only those predators that attacked livestock.
 This could lead to surviving predators avoiding sheep in future.
 However, since the poison is usually very effective, there are very few
 if any survivors.
 The farmer do have the personal satisfaction of the guilty predator being
 killed.

Disadvantages: The greatest disadvantage is that the attacked sheep is still
 killed in order to kill the predator! Moreover, if any predators survive
 biting into the collar, they might learn to avoid the collared sheep only,
 while still attacking other sheep.
 The other great disadvantage of poison collars are high costs of the collars.
 This means that not all sheep can be collared, and thus that sheep without
 LPCs remain vulnerable to predators.
 Additionally, it has all the disadvantages of other kinds of collars (labour,
 collars needing to be replaced regularly in growing sheep, predators changing
 their attack method to avoid the neck or throat, etc.).

Limitations: Depending on the poison used, sometimes scavengers that eat
 from the carcass of the predator killed by the poison might in turn die
 from the poison...
 an ecological ripple effect killing non-target animals and loosing all
 the advantages of the collars being more selective than other uses of poison.
 Because the poison is also dangerous to humans and house animals, care
 is needed when using the collars.
