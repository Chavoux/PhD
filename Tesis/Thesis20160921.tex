\title{``Farming with predators''}

\title{Human-predator conflict on Namibian farmlands: a new approach}

\author{Chavoux Luyt}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Human-wildlife conflict is a worldwide and increasingly important
problem. In the past most \textquotedbl{}solutions\textquotedbl{}
to this conflict has been either from an agricultural perspective
or from a conservation perspective. However, because the goals of
these two perspectives are seldom the same, there has been frustratingly
little progress in preventing human-wildlife conflict. The \textquotedbl{}Farming
with Predators\textquotedbl{} project aims to cross this divide by
providing farmers and land managers with a Decision Support System
(DSS) for reducing human-wildlife conflict making use of both ecological
and agricultural information. In Northern Namibia four predator species
are widely considered as responsible for most livestock losses, leopards
(\textit{Panthera pardus}), cheetahs (\textit{Acinonyx jubatus}),
caracals (\textit{Felis caracal}) and blackjacked jackals (\textit{Canis
mesomelas)}. Two of these predator species are classified as vulnerable
(\textit{Acinonyx jubatus}) and near-threatened (\textit{Panthera
pardus}) in the IUCN Red List of threatened species. Since about 90\%
of Namibia's cheetahs occur on farmlands, finding solutions to conflict
with farmers is a priority, both for cheetah survival and farming
in Namibia. The proposed DSS will make use a cost-benefit analysis
of current anti-predation measures used by Namibian farmers (using
survey data), ecological data on habitat preferences and spatial behaviour
of the predators, predator prey preferences and predator ecological
interactions using a Bayesian Network approach. As more farmers start
using the program, the model will be updated with new data in order
to enable greater accuracy. The practical implications of such models
for sustainable farming and persistence of functioning ecosystems
on farmlands will be discussed as well as a possible wider application
for reducing human-wildlife conflict.

\chapter{The Agricultural perspective: Farmer surveys}

\section{How big is the problem of livestock depredation and predator conflict
really in Namibia?}
\begin{description}
\item [{How}] widespread is Human-Wildlife Conflict involving farmers and
predators really in Namibia? Any geographical hotspots? How big are
farmers' losses? And what is happening to the predator populations
on farms (according to the farmers)?
\end{description}

\section{Baseline data to use for training the Probabilistic Graphical Model}
\begin{description}
\item [{Cost-benefit}] analysis of methods (+ other pros \& cons) currently
used by Namibian farmers (will be very rough at this stage, but the
best we have). Compared with South African data where available.
\end{description}

\chapter{Spatial behaviour and habitat preferences}

\section{Comparing the spatial behaviour of 4 predator species}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tracking: July 2014 - March 2015 - Good method \citep{Stander_et_al_1997b}
\item Literature for each species
\end{itemize}

\section{Spoor tracking: The good, the bad and the ugly}
\begin{description}
\item [{Use}] similar method to that for unmarked species to estimate (relative)
densities of predators and prey. Compare to camera trap estimates
(and game count data from farmer). Discuss advantages of spoor tracking
compared to other methods (Non-invasive, cheap, includes behavioural
data, continuous, etc.). Discuss disadvantages of spoor tracking (Good
trackers becoming scarce and few tracking schools to develop skills,
seldom able to ID individuals from tracks \textendash{} and thus bad
estimate of densities \textendash , possible skew to roads, the importance
of substrate and vegetation in tracking, some species more difficult
to track than others, etc.). 
\end{description}

\section{How to improve tracking as a tool for science.}
\begin{description}
\item [{FIT}] (Footprint Identification Technology) being developed, my
CyberTracker track app, citizen science, creating tracking jobs and
training schools, using in combination with other methods (dogs, drones
and/or camera traps).
\end{description}

\section{How the spatial behaviour of the 4 predator species feeds into our
PGM}
\begin{description}
\item [{The}] role of density, habitat preferences, intra- and inter-specific
avoidance, aggression and competition. Alternative sources for the
necessary data, seeing as how spoor tracking largely failed.
\end{description}

\chapter{Estimating predator densities from camera traps using Spatially Explicit
Capture-Recapture models. }

\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item March - June 2014
\item Which predator species in area?
\item How many individual predators? Density estimates.
\item Leopard-Cheetah fluctuation: Perception (from surveys?), Reality (Cam.
trap data) and possible causes (Behavioural models).
\item Historical data: What do we have? How many individuals? What areas?
How long per individual? Data point frequency? What species? Did the
tagging periods (and place) overlap with the previous camera trap
surveys? What data has already been published and what can still be
used? (Relative Abundance Index)
\end{itemize}

\section{SECR for spotted cats}
\begin{description}
\item [{Determine}] cheetah and leopard densities using SECR and compare
with other studies in Northern Namibia.
\end{description}

\section{Determining densities for unmarked species}
\begin{description}
\item [{Try}] to determine jackal and caracal densities from the Camera
Trap studies using approximations when individuals cannot be identified.
Compare with published studies (for caracals in Namibia and outside
Namibia for jackals in comparable habitat). Use the same method to
estimate prey availability and density.
\end{description}

\section{Predator density and prey requirements}
\begin{description}
\item [{How}] predator density and prey requirements (including prey switching
to livestock at low wild prey densities - see \citet{Khorozyan_et_al_2015})
influence the model (PGM) for our DSS (Decision Support System)
\end{description}

\chapter{The final Decision Support System (DSS)}

\section{User Interface of the DSS (Web application)}
\begin{description}
\item [{The}] DSS user interface will be a web application written in Python.
It consists of 3 parts: Specific inputs from the farmer, stored data
inputs (the model) and the outputs (see Figure \vref{fig:DSS}). 
\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{fig:DSS}\textit{The Decision Support System}}

\includegraphics[angle=270,origin=ct,width=0.8\paperwidth]{Images/DSS1}
\end{figure}
\end{description}
\begin{itemize}
\item Inputs by farmers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Online interface, similar to survey from chapter 4.
\end{itemize}
\item Model (cf. chapter 3):
\begin{itemize}
\item Three parts with some overlap:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sustainability: Use biodiversity and stocking rates (compared to district
rainfall/vegetation type) as proxies for sustainability (maybe include
little human disturbance also).
\item Practical: Some methods can be excluded simply because they are impractical
in some situations; they are not simply too expensive or not effective;
they cannot be implemented at all for various reasons (e.g. a stud
farm cannot suddenly switch to another breed, or dogs with cattle,
or electrifying fences around large (20 000 ha +), mountainous farms,
or labour-intensive methods for part-time \textquotedbl{}weekend\textquotedbl{}
farmers).
\item Cost-effectiveness: How many weaners/female survive using the method/cost
spent implementing (also include costs of changing current methods
to start implementing it).
\end{itemize}
\item Include other methods from outside Namibia (identified in lit. review)
for discussion of pros and cons
\item Commercial vs communal: The results might not be applicable in most
of Africa? Communal excluded for now?
\item (How predators use their territories. Determining factors (Dempster-Shafer
model?).) Not practical for now?
\item Easy-to-use interface for non-programmers to change the model and
update data with new research
\end{itemize}
\item Outputs:
\begin{itemize}
\item Decision support system for farmers. With 3 top options and advantages
and disadvantages of each.
\item Extrapolate: Where are predators most likely to be? Does that correlate
to conservancies/communal land etc. ???
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Technology used in the DSS}
\begin{description}
\item [{Short}] discussion of the technology that was used for creating
the DSS, advantages and disadvantages, and lessons learned.
\end{description}

\section{Automatic update of DSS model}
\begin{description}
\item [{Using}] the input data from the farmers about their current methods,
to update the model over time. How garbage data is to identified and
filtered out. Also the possible use of data from CyberTracker App
to update the model.
\item [{Possibly}] include \textquotedbl{}feedback page\textquotedbl{}
where farmers can explicitly share their experiences.
