	abstract = "Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) were once one of the most widely distributed of all land mammals, but over recent decades their numbers have plummeted by almost 90\%, from around 100,000 in 1900 to fewer than 12,000 in 1990 (Marker 1998; IUCN/SSC 2007a, b; Morrison et al. 2007). Over roughly the same period their geographic range, once incorporating at least 44 countries spanning the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and the length of Africa, has shrunk to 29 countries, with most of the extirpation having occurred over the past 50 years (Marker 1998). Even these dismal ��figures cloak the reality: 50\% of countries still containing cheetahs no longer have viable populations (Marker 2002), with many surviving cheetahs now dispersed in small, fragmented populations (Marker 1998). Cheetahs have fared worst in the northern part of their historic range. Formerly abundant throughout the Middle East and India, the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) survives in small, fragmented pockets, as do those in north, west, and central Africa (Nowell and Jackson 1996; Marker 1998). The reasons for this precipitous decline vary with locality but include combinations of habitat loss and fragmentation, natural prey base depletion, and persecution due to con��flict with humans (Nowell and Jackson 1996; Marker 2002). Considering the general vulnerability of the remaining populations, the most secure cheetah populations are those that are large and less fragmented. These are con��fined to sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Tanzania and Kenya and most especially Namibia, which supports an estimated 3000 individuals, or perhaps 25\% of the world{\rq}s cheetahs (Marker 1998; Marker et al. 2007). Numerically at least, the cheetahs of Namibia are therefore the most important in the world, making it vitally important to understand the threats they face and potential options for alleviating them. Moreover, an estimated 95\% of remaining Namibian cheetahs now range across human-dominated land (Marker 2002), a situation likely to become more common for wild felids as wilderness shrinks ever further. The purpose of this case study is to explore the con��flict between cheetahs and people in this landscape and, considering what is known of cheetah biology, to consider practical solutions.",

@incollection{Balme_et_al_2010,
	abstract = "In principle, the trophy hunting of large carnivores has substantial potential to foster their conservation (Lindsey et al. 2007; Loveridge et al. 2007b). Predators may be tolerated to a greater extent when they augment human livelihoods, and hunting may be a means by which private landowners and local communities can generate revenue from the presence of carnivores (Leader-Williams and Hutton 2005). If the pro��fits realized from harvesting a few individuals are suf��ficient incentive for people to tolerate the larger population, the goals of trophy hunting and conservation are compatible. However, poorly managed trophy hunting may produce a variety of deleterious effects on carnivore populations. Excessive and sustained harvesting of a species can lead to its local extinction, or reduce numbers to such an extent that a population is no longer viable in the long term (Treves and Karanth 2003). Similarly, even when quotas for trophies appear conservative, hunting may constitute additive rather than compensatory mortality, particularly given that other anthropogenic sources of mortality are rarely included in the calculation of quotas (Caro et al. 1998). Additionally, uncontrolled trophy hunting may erode the genetic diversity of a species by consistently selecting the ��fittest individuals in a population that would normally survive to propagate the species, particularly adult breeding males and females (Harris et al. 2002; Coltman et al. 2003). Finally, hunting can alter demographic patterns in carnivore populations, resulting in impacts on non-hunted cohorts (Tuyttens and Macdonald 2000). Accordingly, for trophy hunting to be considered a legitimate tool in the management and conservation of carnivores, it is essential that hunting practices avoid detrimental impacts on populations and are demonstrated to be biologically sustainable. In Botswana and the Niassa Province in Mozambique, assessments of trophy quality are used to promote sustainable leopard hunting (Begg and Begg 2007; Funston, personal communication). Quotas are assigned independently to regions, depending on the sex and age of animals taken in the previous hunting season. These systems are self-regulating and encourage ecologically sound hunting by penalizing hunters that shoot females or under-age leopards. The monitoring of trophy quality and composition will also help gauge whether there are any undesirable demographic shifts within a population (Anderson and Lindzey 2005). As a ��first step, we recommend the delineation of leopard sub-populations that could act as source or sink areas utilizing GIS coverages that include habitat and land-use type, records of leopard presence, patterns of problem-leopard complaints, historical utilization patterns of leopards, and the demand for CITES tags (Cougar Management Guidelines Working Group 2005). Similarly, our approach may have value for other large, wide-ranging felids that are sport-hunted, for example, cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) in Namibia which are hunted exclusively on private land (CITES 1992), pumas in Latin American populations, where sport hunting is growing (Ojasti 1997), and Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in Norway, where quotas are assigned on the basis of depredation complaints (Andren et al. 2006). Protocol Our protocol was based on ��five key recommendations intended to achieve objectives 1--3 listed earlier. These recommendations, and the rationale behind them, were as follows: 1. Cap the number of CITES permits allocated in KZN to ��five each year. When South Africa{\rq}s annual CITES quota of 75 leopards was doubled in October 2004, 10 permits were made available for trophy hunting in KZN. A population and habitat viability analysis (PHVA) which evaluated the possible effects of increasing the leopard harvest suggested that the KZN population had a much greater likelihood of suffering signi��ficant impacts from hunting than did more robust populations elsewhere in South Africa (Daly et al. 2005). This was primarily because the level of illegal killing of leopards by humans was estimated to be among the highest in the country. According to the PHVA, the risk of extinction rose from 11\% to 62\% and the mean population size declined from an estimated 393 animals to 217 with a quota of 10 leopards (Fig. 14.2; Daly et al. 2005). Thus, despite the relatively large estimated population size and carrying capacity, the removal of just ��five additional leopards per year put this population at substantially greater risk (Daly et al. 2005). 2. Allocate applications for leopard hunts to individual properties rather than hunting out��fitters. In the past, any number of hunting out��fitters could apply to hunt leopards on the same property, with potential for consecutive hunts during the year and multiple animals being removed from a single farm in a year. Under the new protocol, landowners applied for a hunt to take place on a particular property (this applies whether the land is privately or communally owned). If successful, the property, not the property owner or hunting out��fitter, was allocated the leopard hunt. It then fell to the property owner to negotiate the best deal from an out��fitter and inform EKZNW of the name of the out��fitter and timing of the proposed hunt so that the CITES permit could be issued. 3. Ensure a more even distribution of CITES permits across the province. As discussed earlier, CITES permits were formerly allocated unevenly across the province where it was both feasible to hunt leopards and where landowners sought to host hunts. To distribute hunting opportunities more evenly, we demarcated ��five leopard-hunting zones (LHZ), each with a population considered extensive and robust enough to sustain hunting (Fig. 14.3). Each LHZ covered an area of at least 600 km2 and lay adjacent to a protected area of at least 290 km2 in which hunting was prohibited. Based on density estimates from mark--recapture statistics applied to camera trapping we conducted in the main land use types in which leopards occur in KZN (11.11 leopards/100 km2 in protected areas, 7.17 leopards/100 km2 in game ranches, and 2.49 leopards/100 km2 in non-protected areas; Balme et al. 2009b), we estimated that each LHZ contained at least 25 adults and was adjacent to a protected source population with at least 32 adults. Each LHZ quali��fied for a single permit (i.e. only one animal can be hunted each year) and had its own individual draw and waiting list. A CITES permit allocated to one LHZ could not be used in another LHZ, regardless of demand, or of the success of hunts. If a leopard was not shot on the ��first allocated property within 1 month (rather than the previously stipulated 2 weeks), the permit was moved to the next property on the waiting list of that particular LHZ, and so on. 4. Link the likelihood of obtaining a tag to the size of the property on which the hunt will take place. Properties within an LHZ were still drawn at ran- dom; however, the chance of a property being selected was weighted according to its size. This was based on the assumption that, in the same area, larger properties are likely to sustain more leopards. Therefore, for every 1.0 km2 of land per property, that property quali��fied for a single {\lq}ticket{\rq} in the draw for that LHZ. Thus, a 5 km2 property was eligible for 5 tickets, a 25 km2 property was eligible for 25 tickets, and so on. In any one draw, the probability of any property being selected increased with its size. Once a property had been allocated a CITES tag, all of its tickets were removed before the next draw which established the ��first property on the waiting list, and so on. 5. Restrict the trophy hunting of leopards in KZN to adult males. South Africa is one of the few countries that have historically allowed the hunting of female leopards. The PHVA demonstrated that harvesting only males resulted in lower extinction rates for all provinces but was most bene��ficial in KZN, where the risk of extinction decreased by almost half (Daly et al. 2005). Therefore, it was proposed that only adult male leopards over 3 years old should be legally hunted in KZN. At this age, male leopards are easily distinguishable from females; the majority of 3-year-old males weigh over 60 kg (mean ¼ 64.50 {\AE} 3.7 SE kg and n ¼ 10; G.A. Balme and L.T.B. Hunter, Panthera, unpublished data) which is considerably heavier than females (mean ¼ 35 {\AE} 3.5 SE kg and n ¼ 7) and they show numerous obvious physical differences (Fig. 14.4). All hunters taking leopards in South Africa are required to be accompanied by a professional hunter (PH) who is responsible for reporting the hunt to EKZNW. An EKZNW of��ficer is required to inspect the trophy within 24 h of the hunt and, provided all legal stipulations are met, issue a CITES tag so that the trophy can be exported. It is the responsibility of the PH conducting the hunt to judge whether the animal to be shot is an adult male. A printed guide is provided by EKZNW (Balme and Hunter, in press) to PHs and hunting clients to assist them in sexing and aging animals so that the likelihood of shooting females is reduced.",

For example, 35 cameras at Sevilleta Fish and National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico, USA have produced more than 1.9m useful images since June 2009. A US Fish and Wildlif monitoring program is producing about 30,000 images per week. Although image file retrieval and storage is trivial, data entry and analysis are both time consuming and error prone since data is most often entered by hand from a keyboard into a spreadsheet. Our objectives were to increase data entry speed while minimizing data entry errors, easily run data analysis, and enable data from multiple locations to be concatenated and analyzed as a single data set. These objectives are achieved by eliminating the task of hand data entry via a keyboard, and managing user interactions with image file data through the use of a suite of open software tools. Error-checking is also automatic. Here we update the methodology described in Harris et al.

This document must be included/understood as a working paper prepared by a small group of experts, subject to the authorities of the lion range states as well as those from the international scientific community. It is intended to be used as support for work to come which can and will supplement and improve it at the rate/rhythm of the development of knowledge on the subject. This should not be perceived as a conclusive final image of the conservation of the lion in these two areas. The document is articulated in two parts: − Part I : Lion Status and Distribution Lion population estimates from two recent publications are compared, highlighting the differences and similarities, and analyzing the methodological differences, especially insofar as they explain differences between the two publications. There is a continental overview, and detailed sections for each West and Central African lion range state. A summary of the 2004 assessment of the lion for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is also included. − Part II: Influences Part II describes the various influences on the long-term conservation of the lion in West and Central Africa. Direct influences are the factors responsible for mortality and/or of the morbidity of the lion. These include lion-human conflict, as well as the various types of exploitation of the lion, and finally the various diseases and pathogens which affect the species. Indirect influences are those which degrade in one way or another the conditions necessary for lion conservation, including human factors, habitat loss, and prey availability.

	abstract = "There is growing recognition of the important roles played by predators in regulating ecosystems and sustaining biodiversity. Much attention has focused on the consequences of predator-regulation of herbivore populations, and associated trophic cascades. However apex predators may also control smaller mesopredators through intraguild interactions. Removal of apex predators can result in changes to intraguild interactions and outbreaks of mesopredators (mesopredator release), leading in turn to increased predation on smaller prey. Here we provide a review and synthesis of studies of predator interactions, mesopredator release and their impacts on biodiversity. Mesopredator suppression by apex predators is widespread geographically and taxonomically. Apex predators suppress mesopredators both by killing them, or instilling fear, which motivates changes in behaviour and habitat use that limit mesopredator distribution and abundance. Changes in the abundance of apex predators may have disproportionate (up to fourfold) effects on mesopredator abundance. Outcomes of interactions between predators may however vary with resource availability, habitat complexity and the complexity of predator communities. There is potential for the restoration of apex predators to have bene��fits for biodiversity conservation through moderation of the impacts of mesopredators on their prey, but this requires a whole-ecosystem view to avoid unforeseen negative effects.",

The objective was to compare caracal densities close to the agricultural land with those deeper in a national park. Two long-distance transects, one along the Namibian border and one diverging from the Namibian border into the interior of the Park, were surveyed on a monthly basis. Spoor density, discrete track set distances and orientation of spoor to the road were recorded and analysed to establish use patterns for three distinct zones in the Park. The hypothesis tested was that increased spoor counts along the border should result from an attraction to the adjacent agricultural (cattle and sheep production) land. It is shown that caracals avoid the areas near the Namibian border during the hot season but increased their utilization in this region in the cold season. This implies that under conditions of low prey availability (cold season) caracals may move to the border and cross onto agricultural land to prey on small livestock, there.",

Previous studies on GPS collars have tried to determine the causes of location error without attempting to investigate whether the accuracy of fixes provides a correspondingly accurate measure of the animal's natural behavior. When comparing 2 types of GPS collar, we found a significant effect of collar weight and fit on the rate of travel of plains zebra (Equus burchelli antiquorum) females in the Makgadikgadi, Botswana. Although both types of collar were well within accepted norms of collar weight, the slightly heavier collars (0.6\% of total body mass [TBM]) reduced rate of travel by >50\% when foraging compared with the collar that was 0.4\% of TBM. Collar effect was activity specific, particularly interfering with grazing behavior; the effect was less noticeable when zebras crossed larger interpatch distances. We highlight that small differences in collar weight or fit can affect specific behaviors, limiting the extrapolation of fine-scaled GPS data. This has important implications for wildlife biologists, who hitherto have assumed that collars within accepted weight limits have little or no effect on animal movement parameters.",

	abstract = "Most ecological and behavioral research on large African carnivores has been conducted on protected populations in national parks, where individual animals are habituated to vehicles and readily approached. Habituated lions (Panthera leo) can be individually recognized through natural markings such as whisker spot patterns (Pennycuick and Rudnai 1970), scars, and ear damage. If they must be handled for marking, radiocollaring, and biomedical sampling, they can usually be darted from a vehicle (e.g. Mills 1996). However, due to the rapid decline of predators outside protected areas (Woodroffe 2001), there is urgent need for management and conservation research on nonprotected populations. Persecuted carnivores become wary of vehicles, and capturing these animals with traditional methods is difficult at best, requiring a major investment in time and effort. Obtaining a meaningful and unbiased sample of animals may be impossible using such techniques. Further, traditional methods have significant drawbacks. Foot snares (Proulx 1999) have long been used to capture bears (Ursus spp.) and have been adapted for mountain lions (Puma concolor; Logan et al. 1999); tigers (Panthera tigris; Goodrich et al. 2001), lynx (Lynx canadensis; Mowat et al. 1994), foxes (Vulpes vulpes), and coyotes (Canis latrans; Shivik et al. 2000). In this paper we describe the use of foot snares to capture nonhabituated lions and other large African carnivores. Foot snares are cheap, easily transported, and can be set by a single person if necessary. A large cage trap, on the other hand, costs several hundred dollars to construct, needs frequent repair, and requires a large team and a truck to move it. Foot snares suffer two main disadvantages: 1) As with any foot-capture system, they are nonselective: compared to drive-up darting or mass capture, one cannot easily choose which lion gets caught; and 2) large animals must be chemically immobilized for release. Thus, the capture team must be experienced and equipped with appropriate drugs and darting equipment. Nontargets up to the size of a striped hyena, however, can be released by restraining them with a catch pole.",

An unintended consequence is the strong modulation of the threeway interaction involving people, predators and prey, a dynamic that questions the extent to which animal distributions and interactions are independent of subtle human influences. Here, I capitalize on the remarkable 9-day synchronicity in which 90\% of moose neonates in the Yellowstone Ecosystem are born, to demonstrate a substantive change in how prey avoid predators; birth sites shift away from traffic-averse brown bears and towards paved roads. The decadelong modification was associated with carnivore recolonization, but neither mothers in bear-free areas nor non-parous females altered patterns of landscape use. These findings offer rigorous support that mammals use humans to shield against carnivores and raise the possibility that redistribution has occurred in other mammalian taxa due to human presence in ways we have yet to anticipate. To interpret ecologically functioning systems within parks, we must now also account for indirect anthropogenic effects on species distributions and behaviour.",

	abstract = "Mammalian carnivores fall into two broad dietary groups: smaller carnivores (,20 kg) that feed on very small prey (invertebrates and small vertebrates) and larger carnivores (.20 kg) that specialize in feeding on large vertebrates. We develop a model that predicts the mass-related energy budgets and limits of carnivore size within these groups. We show that the transition from small to large prey can be predicted by the maximization of net energy gain; larger carnivores achieve a higher net gain rate by concentrating on large prey. However, because it requires more energy to pursue and subdue large prey, this leads to a 2-fold step increase in energy expenditure, as well as increased intake. Across all species, energy expenditure and intake both follow a three-fourths scaling with body mass. However, when each dietary group is considered individually they both display a shallower scaling. This suggests that carnivores at the upper limits of each group are constrained by intake and adopt energy conserving strategies to counter this. Given predictions of expenditure and estimates of intake, we predict a maximum carnivore mass of approximately a ton, consistent with the largest extinct species. Our approach provides a framework for understanding carnivore energetics, size, and extinction dynamics. Carnivores fall into two dietary groups based on the energetic requirements of their feeding strategies: small-bodied species, which feed mostly on prey smaller than themselves, and large-bodied species, which prefer prey around their own size. While carnivores around the size of a lynx or larger can obtain higher net energy intake by switching to relatively large prey, the difficulty of catching and subduing these animals means that a large-prey specialist would expend twice as much energy as a small-prey specialist of equivalent body size. Analyzing the balance between energy intake and expenditure across a range of species, we predict that mammalian carnivores should have a maximum body mass of one ton. Thus, mammalian carnivores are relatively small compared with the largest extinct terrestrial herbivorous mammals, such as the Indricothere, which weighed around 15 tons. The largest existing carnivore, the polar bear, is only around half a ton, while the largest known extinct carnivores, such as the short-faced bear, weighed around one ton. This study suggests that those extremely large carnivores would have been heavily reliant on abundant large prey, helping to explain why the largest modern mammalian carnivores are rare and vulnerable to extinction.",

	abstract = "Carnivore conservation depends on the sociopolitical landscape as much as the biological landscape. Changing political attitudes and views of nature have shifted the goals of carnivore management from those based on fear and narrow economic interests to those based on a better understanding of ecosystem function and adaptive management. In parallel, aesthetic and scientific arguments against lethal control techniques are encouraging the development of nonlethal approaches to carnivore management. We anticipate greater success in modifying the manner and frequency with which the activities of humans and domestic animals intersect with those of carnivores. Success should permit carnivore populations to persist for decades despite human population growth and modification of habitat. Carnivore management now stands at a crossroads in many regions of the world. In some areas, carnivore populations have recovered to the point that regulated harvest is being considered. In others, threats to carnivores are growing despite efforts at preservation. We believe that the tactics employed for the mitigation of human-carnivore conflict will determine the future course of carnivore management in both these situations. We suggest that solutions to human-carnivore conflict can be classified as those that modify behavior (that of humans, live-stock, or carnivores) and those that prevent the activities of humans and carnivores from intersecting in space. We believe that future carnivore managers will increasingly employ a mix of strategies involving nonlethal modification of carnivore behavior, a change in human behavior, prevention of conflicts through spatial separation, and use of lethal controls only where absolutely essential. These solutions must be situation-specific and driven by scientific data (both biological and social), not by fears and prejudices against carnivores. We recommend that attention be directed to understanding and reducing human causes of carnivore mortality because this may result in the speedier recovery of many populations. In addition, information on the locations and participants in human-carnivore conflict may aid in the prediction, prevention, and mitigation of future conflicts (Treves et al. 2004). The job of conservation biologists is to inform the public and policy-makers about locally feasible options based on careful research. Close coordination with managers will be essential.",

Adult males are involved in more depredation events than any other age or gender class, and there is little evidence that juvenile or old individuals prey disproportionately on livestock. Surplus killing should be regarded as an extension of natural multiple killing behavior rather than as evidence of a problem individual. Field data do not yet allow us to determine whether there are in fact any individual differences when livestock availability and differential encounter rates are considered. The only way to obtain the field data is to intensively monitor the movements and predation behavior of different individuals in relation to the distribution of livestock. Such work is difficult and expensive, but vital to determine whether there is any scientific basis to the established management paradigm of problem-individual removal. We hypothesize that most individuals of large carnivore species will at least occasionally kill accessible livestock that they encounter. If true, this implies that problem individual control will need to remove most individuals that have the possibility to encounter livestock. This may be acceptable if carnivore conservation is based on livestock-free wilderness areas or landuse zones, but it will not function in multi-use landscapes where livestock are dispersed throughout the area where carnivores are to be conserved.},

Such conflict has led to the extirpation of these species from many areas, and also impacts the livelihoods of local livestock farmers. To investigate the possibilities for coexistence of people, livestock, and large predators in community rangelands, we measured the effectiveness of traditional livestock husbandry in reducing depredation by wild carnivores, using a case--control approach. Different measures were effective against different predator species but, overall, the risk of predator attack by day was lowest for small herds, accompanied by herd dogs as well as human herders, grazing in open habitat. By night, the risk of attack was lowest for herds held in enclosures ({\lq}bomas{\rq}) with dense walls, pierced by few gates, where both men and domestic dogs were present. Unexpectedly, the presence of scarecrows increased the risks of attack on bomas.

This can largely be ascribed to a lack of knowledge of the basic factors influencing predator and prey populations. Scientists today realize that the dynamics of specific animal populations cannot be divorced from those of associated populations or from the environment as a whole. The laboratory predator-prey models of Lotka (1925) and Volterra (1926) simply are not representative of most field situations, because predators no longer determine exclusively the abundance of their prey. The intricate and at times subtle relationships between predators and their environment remain one of the most stimulating, yet involved, aspects of biological research and require an increasing amount of cooperation between field biologists and mathematicians. Wildebeest and zebra need to be encouraged to form mobile aggregations rather than to become sedentary and dispersed into small groups or herds. Factors influencing their movements and distribution need to be monitored over long periods of time so that the necessary steps can be taken to alleviate some of the problems.

	abstract = "There are many cases where animal populations are affected by predators and resources in terrestrial ecosystems, but the factors that determine when one or the other predominates remain poorly understood. Here we show, using 40 years of data from the highly diverse mammal community of the Serengeti ecosystem, East Africa, that the primary cause of mortality for adults of a particular species is determined by two factors---the species diversity of both the predators and prey and the body size of that prey species relative to other prey and predators. Small ungulates in Serengeti are exposed to more predators, owing to opportunistic predation, than are larger ungulates; they also suffer greater predation rates, and experience strong predation pressure. A threshold occurs at prey body sizes of 150 kg, above which ungulate species have few natural predators and exhibit food limitation. Thus, biodiversity allows both predation (top-down) and resource limitation (bottom-up) to act simultaneously to affect herbivore populations. This result may apply generally in systems where there is a diversity of predators and prey. Each carnivore species includes prey outside their preferred size range but is inefficient at catching such prey. So, while lions are less efficient at catching gazelle (Gazella sp.) than catching wildebeest, they do so if opportunities present themselves. Hence, gazelle are less vulnerable to lion predation, despite their small size, than are wildebeest. Overall, the diet niche of smaller carnivores is nested within that of larger carnivore species (Fig. 1). In a study area of northern Serengeti that has been monitored since 1966, poaching and indiscriminate poisoning removed the majority of carnivores (notably lion, hyena and jackals from evidence on observed carcasses and absence of calls) for an eight-year period (1980--87). In the contiguous Mara Reserve of Kenya, a part of the same ecosystem, predator populations remained intact. During the predator removal period, five smaller-bodied species (oribi, Thomson's gazelle, warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), impala (Aepyceros melampus) and topi (Damaliscus lunatus)) for which data were available, increased markedly in density in the predator removal area relative to their populations in the non-removal area (Fig. 4). These populations declined once predators returned to the area. In contrast, abundance of one of the largest ungulates, the giraffe, did not increase in the predator removal area over the eight-year period (Fig. 4).",

	abstract = "Data from long-term ecological studies further understanding of ecosystem dynamics and can guide evidence-based management. In a quasi-natural experiment we examined long-term monitoring data on different components of the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem to trace the effects of disturbances and thus to elucidate cause-and-effect connections between them. The long-term data illustrated the role of food limitation in population regulation in mammals, particularly in migratory wildebeest and nonmigratory buffalo. Predation limited populations of smaller resident ungulates and small carnivores. Abiotic events, such as droughts and floods, created disturbances that affected survivorship of ungulates and birds. Such disturbances showed feedbacks between biotic and abiotic realms. Interactions between elephants and their food allowed savanna and grassland communities to co-occur. With increased woodland vegetation, predators{\rq} capture of prey increased. Anthropogenic disturbances had direct (hunting) and indirect (transfer of disease to wildlife) effects. Slow and rapid changes and multiple ecosystem states became apparent only over several decades and involved events at different spatial scales. Conservation efforts should accommodate both infrequent and unpredictable events and long-term trends. Management should plan on the time scale of those events and should not aim to maintain the status quo. Systems can be self-regulating through food availability and predator-prey interactions; thus, culling may not be required. Ecosystems can occur in multiple states; thus, there may be no a priori need to maintain one natural state. Finally, conservation efforts outside protected areas must distinguish between natural change and direct human-induced change. Protected areas can act as ecological baselines in which human-induced change is kept to a minimum. Whereas food supply limits the migrant population of Recent studies (Hopcraft et al. 2005) demonstrate that lions{\rq} hunting success, their functional response to prey populations, is determined by the availability of dense cover for ambush rather than by the density of prey. These studies predict that the increase in dense cover due to the increase in young tree populations has benefited lions by enabling them to catch more prey; and greater hunting success should yield a decline in prey numbers. Population data indicate there has been a decline in most species of small- and medium-sized resident antelopes in the same area of the eastern woodlands.",

	abstract = "In Zimbabwe the incidence of reported jackal rabies varies predictably over the year with peaks during June to August (cold dry season) and December to May (wet season), and may be explained by the social behaviour of jackals. June to August is the mating season, at which time home ranges increase in size, and overlap between species and neighbouring conspecifics is greater. Intra-group concordance in range use decreases in association with the social stress caused by mating and mate guarding, and young adults use peripheral areas, perhaps increasing contact with neighbouring jackals. Dispersal is most likely to occur in the mating season. These factors increase the contact rate between neighbours and, therefore, rabies incidence. In the hot dry season (the whelping season), home ranges decrease in size, and the overlap of interspecific and neighbouring conspecific ranges decreases. Concordance in range use of intra-group conspecifics increases and activity focuses on the den; inter-group contact rate therefore decreases, as does rabies incidence. The addition of juveniles to the population in the wet season increases jackal density and thus contact rate and also coincides with a high rabies incidence. Taking these factors into account, we suggest that the control of jackal rabies by oral vaccination should focus on the period before the mating season and after the whelping season.",

Spatial autocorrelation, which comes either from the physical forcing of environmental variables or from community processes, presents a problem for statistical testing because autocorrelated data violate the assumption of independence of most standard statistical procedures. The paper discusses first how autocorrelation in ecological variables can be described and measured, with emphasis on mapping techniques. Then, proper statistical testing in the presence of autocorrelation is briefly discussed. Finally, ways are presented of explicitly introducing spatial structures into ecological models. Two approaches are proposed; in the raw-data approach, the spatial structure takes the form of a polynomial of the x and y geographic coordinates of the sampling stations; in the matrix approach, the spatial structure is introduced in the form of a geographic distance matrix among locations. These two approaches are compared in the concluding section. A table provides a list of computer programs available for spatial analysis.",

	abstract = "The backbone of this study was a systems thinking based analysis of the management and control of predators as practiced in South Africa since the advent of Europeans in 1652. The first bounties were introduced for a variety of animal species in 1656. Many species became labeled as vermin and were persecuted, often with the intention of eradication. A variety of controls have been applied, of which many have not kept pace with contemporary thinking or technology, and which by simply killing predators fail to address the crux of the issue of predator -- livestock conflict. Many of the methods used cannot be applied to specifically remove an individual damage-causing animal. Considerable collateral ecological damage is inflicted by the killing of animals regarded as innocent bystanders. The objective of the analysis was to highlight the futility of temporary solutions which fail to resolve the conflict in the long term. These quick fixes frequently perpetuate an ecological imbalance which exacerbates the predator -- livestock conflict. The analysis used raw data from a questionnaire survey conducted by the Poison Working Group of the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT-PWG) (2003). The EWT-PWG intended to assess pesticide abuse as toxicant for predators by farmers, and to identify all control methods used. The data forthcoming was Cartesian in nature and a fixed snap-shot in time. This study sought to identify the root cause of the conflict by applying systems thinking which added the dimension of cause and effect interrogation. The study categorised and described predator conflict management methods as lethal or preventative, and assessed each category in archetypal terms from a systems thinking perspective. It also sought to identify leverage points, or small changes which have profound effects, to stimulate a change in approach to humanpredator conflict management. In order to assess and illustrate the positive change brought about by application of preventative methods, a small group of farmers who had initiated changes in their predator conflict management over the five years subsequent to the EWTPWG survey were selected from the original group for reassessment. Through evaluation of predator conflict management methods from a systems thinking perspective, and by probing learning processes, the shortcomings or failure of inappropriate management responses to conflict situations were shown to exacerbate conflicts. Contrarily, it was illustrated that application of systems thinking and a process of addressing the root cause of conflict issues in predator conflict management, was a longer term solution. The study illustrated that application of long term proactive prevention and conflict avoidance principles, can offer long term solutions for predator conflict managers.",

I review and integrate recent empirical and theoretical work on spontaneous mutation and its role in population viability and conservation planning. I analyze both the maintenance ofpotentially adaptive genetic variation in quantitative characters and the role of detrimental mutations in increasing the extinction risk of small populations. Recent experiments indicate that the rate ofproduction of quasineutral, potentially adaptive genetic variance in quantitative characters is an order of magnitude smaller than the total mutational variance because mutations with large phenotypic effects tend to be strongly detrimental. This implies that, to maintain normal adaptive potential in quantitative characters under a balance between mutation and random genetic drift (or among mutation, drift, and stabilizing natural selection), the effective population size should be about 5000 rather than 500 (the Franklin- Soule number). Recent theoretical results suggest that the risk of extinction due to the fixation of mildly detri- mental mutations may be comparable in importance to environmental stochasticity and could substantially decrease the long-term viability of populations with effective sizes as large as a few thousand. These findings suggest that current recovery goals for many threatened and endangered species are inadequate to ensure long-term population viability",

Few data exist on the spatial ecology of cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus outside protected areas, but such areas are particularly important to their conservation. Cheetahs on Namibian farmlands occupied exceptionally large home ranges, averaging 1651 km2 ( +- 1594 km2), with no detectable effect of sex, social grouping or seasonality. Despite such large ranges, cheetahs tended to utilize intensively only a small fraction of that area: 50\% of the ��fixes were located within an average of 13.9 +- 5.3\% of the home range. Ranges were not exclusive, overlapping on average by 15.8 +- 17.0\%, with male cheetahs showing more intra-sexual range overlap than did females. Coalitions of males appeared to select for a dense, prey-rich habitat, but this preference was not apparent for other social groupings. Con��flict with humans is an important contributor to the species{\rq} decline, and these large, overlapping cheetah home ranges result in the movements of each individual cheetah encompassing many farms (21 based on the average home-range size). Consequently, many cheetahs may be exposed to a minority of farmers attempting to kill them, and also that many farmers may see the same cheetahs, thereby gaining an exaggerated impression of their abundance. Conservation priorities for cheetahs outside protected areas are the development of techniques for con��flict resolution, as well as the maintenance and restoration of suitable habitat and promotion of land-management practices compatible with the continued existence of large carnivores.",

While numerous studies have been conducted on leopards within protected areas, more information regarding leopard ecology is needed outside such areas for effective conservation. This study examined the spatial ecology of leopards living on commercial Namibian farmlands, and assessed information from other studies to investigate which factors appeared to influence leopard range size and density. Home range sizes were particularly large in Namibia, with high range overlap, and neither sex exhibited exclusive home range use. There were no significant differences in range size between males and females, or between wet and dry seasons for either sex. Rainfall did not directly affect range size, but exerted an influence via prey biomass. Leopard density was positively correlated with prey biomass and negatively related to range size. Leopards showed marked variation in range size and land tenure systems between studies, reflecting their remarkable ecological flexibility. Nevertheless, large home range sizes and low population densities mean that leopards require large, contiguous tracts of suitable habitat, and that more conservation efforts must be extended beyond protected areas to ensure the long-term viability of leopard populations in such areas.",

	abstract = "Large predators fulfil key roles in maintaining ecosystems through controlling herbivores as well as meso-predators, all of which could impact on the natural biodiversity of an area. The greatest threat to predators and their survival is the loss of habitat and persecution by farmers due to depredation of livestock. Leopards in the Western Cape, South Africa, have managed to survive intense persecution and severe perturbation of their habitat, and are now the last remaining large predator in the area, inhabiting rugged and inhospitable mountains. Whilst leopards have been studied in detail in different habitats of Africa, including forests and savanna, there is a paucity of ecological information from the isolated population of comparatively small leopards found in the Cederberg Mountains of the Western Cape. Between 2004 and 2010, these leopards were studied using remote infra-red camera traps and GPS radio-collars to record data on their home ranges, population density, movements, activity, diet and future status in a human impacted habitat with no large competing carnivores. Working in two biomes, GPS location data were obtained from 11 radio- collared leopards (7 males, 4 females). Homes range sizes were up to 910 km 2 (95\% MCP) for leopards in the Karoo biome, some of the largest recorded for the species. Male ranges were significantly larger than female ranges, and daily displacement for leopards was as much as 30 km. 193 camera trap photographs of 7 adult leopards (2 males, 5 females) were obtained in the Karoo between 2004 and 2007. Combining camera trap and radio-collar data, leopard densities were estimated as 0.25 -- 0.99 leopards/100 km2 in the Karoo and 1.8 -- 2.3 leopards/100 km2 in the Fynbos biome. Leopards were largely nocturnal despite having no large competing predators. Their movements did not appear to be influenced by human activity. Their primary food items were klipspringers and rock hyrax, diurnal herbivores that constituted 78\% of their diet. Livestock were an insignificant prey item. The mountain Fynbos remains largely unchanged. Conservation of this area, carefully managing leopard-conflict situations and identifying possible corridors to aid leopard dispersal, should ensure the long-term conservation of the species here. However, recent transformation of the Karoo suggests further steps need to be investigated, including the possibility of reintroducing an extinct guild of large carnivores, to re-establish a fully functioning system over a greater area.",

	abstract = "In an increasingly human-dominated environment, the task of successfully conserving large carnivores, such as cheetahs, is difficult due to real or perceived threats resulting in conflict and often their local extirpation. This research describes the causes and potential solutions to this conflict in Namibia. Cheetah biology and ecology were studied through physical examination, laboratory analysis, radio-tracking and human perceptions using survey techniques. Between 1991 and 2000 data collected on over 400 live-captured and dead cheetahs showed that a perceived threat to livestock or game was the reason for 91.2\% (n = 343) of cheetahs captured and 47.6\% (n = 30) of wild cheetah deaths. Both were biased towards males, with 2.9 males being captured for every female, despite an apparent equality of sex ratio. Human-mediated mortality accounted for 79.4\% (n = 50) of wild deaths reported, of which the majority involved prime adult animals, with a peak at around 5-6 years of age. Polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to assess 313 Namibian cheetahs{\rq} variation, gene flow, paternity and behavioural ecology. Genetic analysis showed limited regional differentiation supporting a panmictic population and that persistence in Namibia depends on dispersal from regions throughout the country; therefore efforts of connectivity throughout the country should continue. Relatedness values confirmed family groups, and 45 new potential sire/dam offspring and 7 sibling groups were identified, providing information on dispersal and the success of translocation. Sera from wild cheetah were assessed for exposure to feline and canine virus antibodies to CDV, FCoV/FIP, FHV1, FPV, and FCV; antibodies were detected in 24\%, 29\%, 12\%, 48\%, and 65\%, respectively, showing infection occurs in wild cheetahs; although there was no evidence of disease at time of capture, these diseases are known to cause serious clinical disease in captive cheetahs. Neither FIV antibodies nor FeLV antigens were present in any wild cheetahs tested, however, the first case of FeLV in a non-domestic felid is described in a captive Namibian cheetah. Concern for contact with domestic animals is discussed. Focal Palatine Erosion (FPE), a dental abnormality found in captive cheetahs, was discovered in over 70\% of the wild cheetahs and was correlated with dental malocclusions, and is of concern to the long-term health of wild cheetahs. Namibian cheetahs have a mean 95\% kernel home range of 1642.3 km2 (+ 1565.1 km2), the largest home ranges yet defined. Habitat type significantly affected the cheetah{\rq}s spatial distribution and prey density. Radio-collared female cheetahs were more closely related to other cheetahs in the study area than males, indicating male dispersal. Continual cheetah perturbation may partially explain the unusually low density of cheetahs in this area (estimated at only 2.5 cheetahs per 1000km2) despite the apparent abundance of prey. Namibian farmers originally surveyed revealed a mean removal of 19 cheetahs per year/farm, even when not considered a problem, and higher removals occurred on game farms. Evidence for actual livestock depredation was negligible, only 3\% of reported captures. Scat analysis revealed cheetahs{\rq} selection for indigenous game, however 5\% of scats contained evidence of livestock. Research conducted on methods of conflict resolution showed that placing Anatolian Shepherd livestock guarding dogs proved to be effective, with 76\% of farmers reporting a large decline in livestock losses since acquiring an Anatolian. Such solutions appear effective in increasing farmer{\rq}s tolerance for cheetahs, and by the end of the study period cheetah removals dropped to a mean of 2.1 cheetahs/farm/year. Implementing strategies such as these could be significant for reducing human-carnivore conflict in the many other places in which it occurs.",

	abstract = "Protected areas are commonly assumed to (and most do) harbour higher densities of wildlife than adjacent, human-modified landscapes (Woodroffe \& Ginsberg, 1998; Melville \& Bothma, 2006; Gaston et al., 2008; Newmark, 2008; Kiner et al., 2009). In north-central Namibia, farmers believed that leopard (Panthera pardus) densities were growing on farmland areas adjacent to Waterberg Plateau Park and that the Park was a source population for leopards venturing beyond park boundaries during the night to feed on the livestock in the farmlands (Stein, 2008). Leopard densities elsewhere have been correlated with ungulate abundance (Stander et al., 1997; Marker \& Dickman, 2005), but our camera surveys (Stein, Fuller \& Marker, 2008) indicated that leopard prey was more abundant outside of versus inside the Park. Thus, we predicted that leopard density was higher outside of the Park and thus not a population {\lq}sink{\rq} for leopards. To test this hypothesis, we estimated leopard density for both areas via capture--mark--recapture techniques using camera-trapping (e.g., Karanth \& Nichols, 1998; Henschel \& Ray, 2003; Silver et al., 2004; Jackson et al., 2006) combined with home range sizes estimated from telemetry data. This disparity in leopard density is consistent with the general trend in felid densities of correlating with resource availability (cf. Stuart, Macdonald \& Mills, 1985; Stander et al., 1997; Larrucea et al., 2007; Di Bitetti et al., 2008). Our Park leopard density estimate is similar to estimates from arid areas (Bothma \& Le Riche, 1984; Stander et al., 1997), and our farmland density is in line with that from the Serengeti (Schaller, 1972). Areas with more prey (Hamilton, 1976; Norton \& Lawson, 1985; Jenny, 1996) provide more suitable habitat and higher densities of leopards (Hayward, O{\rq}Brien \& Kerley, 2007). The areas with the highest reported densities are protected areas with high densities of leopard prey (Le Roux \& Skinner, 1989; Bailey, 1993; Hayward et al., 2006).",

	abstract = "The conservation of large carnivores is dependent on comprehensive research programs within and surrouding protected areas. In many locations, protected areas are not large enough to support viable large carnivore populations, and thus it is essential to understand the ecology of predators outside of protected areas. On the commercial farms of northcentral Namibia, farmers have systematically removed the largest predators in order to protect their livestock. Leopards are the largest remaining carnivore, aided by their adaptable and secretive nature. In order to properly manage regional leopards, there were several questions about their population size, feeding ecology and movements that needed to be addressed. Leopard population estimates were generated through camera-trapping surveys within and surrounding the Waterberg Plateau Park. These surveys suggest that leopard population density is significantly higher outside of the park, most likely due to environmental factors within the park that limit potential prey. Leopards were shown to primarily feed on wild ungulates, preferring kudu over livestock which they appear to avoid even when livestock densities are higher than individual wild ungulate species. Leopard home ranges and movements were investigated on commercial farmlands where they were not shown to move between the farms and the park. Home range estimates were similar to previous studies for similar environments with marginal resources. Beyond the ecological studies, the attitudes and perceptions of farmers were incorporated into the study in order to assess local predator management with particular emphasis on leopards. Farmers used a variety of livestock husbandry techniques, with varying success. Although there were no clear techniques to reduce conflict, farmers were able to substantially reduce losses by using at least one technique to protect their stock against predators. Farmers listed depredation as the source of highest livestock loss, and leopards the species which caused the most conflict by occurrence. Farmers removed approximately 11 leopards per year in the region which is equal to a 14\% off-take for the local population. Farmer tolerance was assessed by the \% calf loss that farmers were willing to lose to predators annually. Tolerance rates were then compared to annual livestock loss. Leopards, being a charismatic animal for tourists and trophy hunters, were evaluated for potential financial benefits for farmers to mitigate losses. Region-wide management strategies are discussed.",

To one person it is wilderness, to another it is ski lodges for thousands. To one it is estuaries to nourish ducks for hunters to shoot; to another it is factory land. The rebuttal to the invisible hand inpopulation control is to be found in a scenario first sketched in a little-known pamphlet (6) in 1833 by a mathematical amateur named William Forster Lloyd (1794-1852). We may well call it "the tradegy of the commons," ... As a rational being, each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he asks, "What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?" This utility has one negative and one positive component. 1) The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the herdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the positive utility is nearly +1. 2) The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by one more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the herdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decisionmaking herdsman is only a fraction of -1. Adding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. And another; and another.... But this is the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit-in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.},

While considerable research has documented wildlife production on commercial land in many eastern and southern African countries, few studies have focused specically on the integration of livestock and game production in Namibia and Zambia. This paper reports a survey of 43 commercial conservancy members in Namibia and 23 game farmers in Zambia conducted between September 2004 and June 2005. The survey was based on inductive sampling theory and queried farmers on how they have integrated wildlife production into their management practices. Farmers in each country reported considerable integration of wildlife conservation and agricultural production. Namibian farmers reported substantial problems with bush encroachment, whereas none of their Zambian counterparts raised similar complaints. This paper describes the state of rangeland management on commercial farms in Namibia and Zambia and identiWes important areas where further research can contribute to the enhancement of this conservation-production system.",

This study applied rapid rural appraisal techniques, including a questionnaire. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 570 farmers who were registered as cattle producers with the Meat Board of Namibia at their villages. The data collection process was conducted in two months (October 2009 and November 2009). Questionnaires were administered by a group of trained enumerators in the vernacular OtjiHerero language under the supervision of the researcher through door-to-door interviews. Data were gathered on the production system and managerial practices. The research found that the main constraints were incorrect bull-to-cow ratio (1:38), low calving percentage, and high cattle mortalities and losses caused by drought, diseases, straying and theft. The research further found that farmers were applying poor weaning practices and record keeping. Shortcomings on these managerial practices can be addressed if farmers visit the extension and veterinary offices for advice and training. A proper policy guide is required with respect to grazing resource management. Farmers need access to micro-financing for cattle production systems to become economically viable.",

A total of 100 cattle farmers were interviewed and the weighted least square (WLS) model was applied to analyse the data. The study found that the number of cattle owned, cost of production inputs, accessibility to market information, accessibility to local markets and rainfall have a strong influence on the sales volume. The study strongly recommends the formation of cattle marketing groups that can be employed to lower transaction cost, increase bargaining power, access to information and participation in formal markets. There is a need to improve access to institutions and to remove current distortions in the livestock marketing in Namibia. The study shows that there is an inverse relationship between source of information and volume of sales. When the barrier to source of information increases, the volume of sales decreases. The current policy advice should focus on the effects of policy distortions and adequate attention should be given to the serious, embedded institutional deficiencies that limit many communal farmers from taking advantage of market opportunities.",

The problematic caused by these species can be solved through its removal and use as bio-fuel, activity carried out by the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) in agricultural lands of north-central Namibia. The effect of such activity on the richness and abundance of mammals and birds was evaluated. Hence studies were conducted in three experimental plots (where removal was carried out in different years: 2003, 2007 and 2009) and three control plots (no management), where the avifauna and mastofauna was assessed using, respectively, the techniques of point counts-territory mapping and photo-capture with camera traps, as well as the characteristics of the vegetation (i.e. height of shrubs, structural diversity hedging, canopy cover and sighting visibility). The results indicate that the control plots were replicas, while the experimental plots differed by year of removal, being found the biggest differences between control and experimental plots the closer was to management. At the scale made, the treatment does not affect any of the studied species, with the exception of the Kalahari scrub-robin, which was favoured by the treatment. However, if management is not performed properly it could harm many species that employ the bushes (food or habitat). Therefore, restoration programs should focus on selective thinning of woody plants.",

Seventy per cent of the reserve is characterized by very dense thicket vegetation (valley bushveld) and the remainder is open and savanna-like. The results illustrated a strong effect of sex and group size on the behaviour of cheetahs. The coalition (three adult males) killed signi��ficantly larger animals (55\% of kills weighed more than 65 kg) than single female cheetahs (less than 2\% of kills weighed more than 65 kg). Female cheetahs showed temporal and spatial avoidance of lions by hunting at dawn and dusk and positioning their home ranges [95\% utilization distribution (UDs)] signi��ficantly farther from the pride of lions than did the coalition. The coalition hunted earlier and later than female cheetahs, and 46\% of their kills were made in darkness. In addition, their home range overlapped that of the lions and they showed neither temporal nor spatial avoidance of the lions. The rates of kleptoparasitism were lower and the kill retention times were longer than those reported elsewhere in Africa, and it is suggested that this is a consequence of the cover provided by the thicket vegetation and prey size. The home ranges (95\% UDs) of female cheetahs incorporated more thicket vegetation than that of the coalition, indicating that the coalition is less susceptible to predation than single females. These data suggest that cheetahs possess greater behavioural ��flexibility than previously reported, that they can hunt successfully in thicket vegetation, sometimes in darkness, that they are not restricted to killing small to medium-sized prey, and that they may not be savanna specialists.",

Mothers' vigilance during the day was closely associated with measures of hunting but not with measures of anti-predator behaviour. In contrast, mothers' vigilance at kills was not related to hunting but was related to anti-predatorbehaviour. Both forms of vigilance decreased as cubs grew older. Vigilance during the day increased with litter size which supports a model of 'shared' parental investment (Lazarus and Inglis 1986) be cause after prey had been located and caught by mothers, cubs shared the prey between them. Vigilance at kills did not increase with litter size when cubs were young; in these situations predators stole cheetahs' prey and rarely chased cubs so, at most, only a single cub would be taken. Mothers' anti-predator behaviour away from kills did increase with litter size at young cub ages however; more cubs are killed in these circumstances the greater is the size of the litter. When cubs were older and could outrun predators, neither vigilance at kills nor anti-predatorbehaviour increased with litter size. These results strongly support two models of 'unshared' investment (Lazarus and Inglis 1986) and demonstrate, not only that superficially similar behaviour has different functions in different contexts, but that parental investment is shaped by the type of benefits accrued from it.",

	abstract = "As a charismatic carnivore that is vulnerable to extinction, many studies have been conducted on predation by the cheetah Acinonyx jubatus. Cheetah are generally considered to capture medium-sized prey; however, which species are actually preferred and why has yet to be addressed. We used data from 21 published and two unpublished studies from six countries throughout the distribution of the cheetah to determine which prey species were preferred and which were avoided using Jacobs{\rq} index. The mean Jacobs{\rq} index value for each prey species was used as the dependent variable in multiple regression, with prey abundance and prey body mass as predictive variables. Cheetah prefer to kill and actually kill the most available prey present at a site within a body mass range of 23--56 kg with a peak (mode) at 36 kg. Blesbok, impala, Thomson{\rq}s and Grant{\rq}s gazelles, and springbok are signi��ficantly preferred, whereas prey outside this range are generally avoided. The morphological adaptations of the cheetah appear to have evolved to capture medium-sized prey that can be subdued with minimal risk of injury. Coincidentally, these species can be consumed rapidly before kleptoparasites arrive. These results are discussed through the premise of optimality theory whereby decision made by the predator maximize the net energetic bene��fits of foraging. Information is also presented that allows conservation managers to determine which prey species should be in adequate numbers at cheetah reintroduction sites to support a cheetah population. Conversely, these results will illustrate which potential prey species of local conservation concern should be monitored for impact from cheetahs as several species are likely to be preyed upon more frequently than others.",

	abstract = "Mammalian carnivores are unusual because their primary competitors for food are often their primary predators. This relationship is most evident at persistent kills where dominant competitors are attracted to both the carcass (as a free meal) and to the killers (as potential prey). Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are frequent victims of kleptoparasitism, and cubs, and sometimes adults, are killed by lions (Panthera led) or spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta). Between 1980 and 2002, we observed 639 kills made by cheetahs in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. These kills were often visited by scavengers, including relatively innocuous species such as vultures and jackals and potentially dangerous species, like spotted hyenas and lions. We used cheetah behavior at kills to test a number of predictions about how cheetahs should minimize risk at kill sites given they face an increased risk of predation of themselves or their cubs. In particular, we examined the propensity of cheetahs of different age/sex classes to hide carcasses aftermaking a kill, vigilance at kills, and the delay in leaving after finishing feeding with respect to ecological factors and scavenger presence. The behavior of single females at kills did not suggest that they were trying to avoid being killed, but the behavior of males, often found in groups, was in line with this hypothesis. In contrast, the behavior of mother cheetahs at kills appeared to be influenced greatly by the risk of cubs being killed. Our results suggest that cheetahs use several behavioral counter strategies to avoid interspecific predation of self or cubs.",

	abstract = "The status of the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) varies greatly in the 32 countries listed in this report. All populations are classified as vulnerable or threatened by the IUCN (World Conservation Union) and regulated by CITES as Appendix A. There are 13 countries mentioned in this report where the cheetah went extinct in the last 40 years. The wild cheetah is nearly extinct in Asia, with about 100 cheetahs surviving in small pockets in Iran. Free-ranging cheetah inhabit a broad section of Africa, including areas of North Africa, Sahel, eastern and southern Africa. The two strong-holds remain in Kenya and Tanzania in East Africa and Namibia and Botswana in southern Africa. Although there has not been a comprehensive review of African cheetah since 1975, there is a consensus that the cheetah population is declining throughout Africa. Since 1991 and updated regularly since, CCF has been in communication with researchers in cheetah range countries on the cheetah populations in those countries. From the information it appears that less than 15000 cheetahs remain, with a low estimate of 9000 and an optimistic estimate of 12000 animals. Individual numbers of animals may not be the point, but the the number of viable populations still existing. Viable populations may be found in only half or less of the countries where cheetahs still exist. There has been a devastating decline in both habitat and prey for cheetah. In addition, the species do not well in protected game reserves due to competition with other large predators and the captive population is not self-sustaining, but is maintained through imports of cheetahs from the wild population.",

	abstract = "The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) has long been regarded as a significant threat to the interests of farmers of both game and livestock in Namibia and for this reason has been removed in large numbers. However, the diet of these cheetahs has not been documented; such documentation is an important component of any effective conservation plan. We performed feeding trials to relate more accurately the remains found in cheetah scats to the number of prey animals consumed. Using scat analysis techniques, we found that cheetah prey size ranged from birds and hares to large antelope. They rarely preyed on domestic stock, with apparent selection towards common, indigenous game species. Information gathered from aerial sightings of kills was significantly biased towards larger prey species. Data on the number of times cheetahs were seen near livestock or game were found to not be representative of the type of prey taken when compared to corrected scat analysis. Due to the diurnal nature and wide-ranging habits of cheetahs, they are sighted relatively frequently near stock, which may contribute to an exaggerated perception of their predation on stock. From the results of this study, livestock predation by cheetahs was estimated to account for at least 0.01 calves and 0.004 sheep per km2 on the Namibian farmlands, and may be substantially more depending on cheetah density. Any stock losses as a result of cheetahs and other predators can have economic impacts for farmers, and management techniques for mitigating such losses are suggested. The use of controlled feeding trials and subsequent calculation of a correction factor for scat analysis could be a valuable tool for gaining a more accurate estimate of carnivore diet in future studies.",

	abstract = "Reintroduction is defined as an attempt to establish species in an area that once was a part of its historical range, but from which it has been extirpated or become extinct. Historically, one of the most successful programs was the reintroduction of 254 American blackbears (Ursus americanus) from Minnesota to the Interior Highlands of Arkansas in the 1960s; that population has grown to >2,500 today. More recent efforts have involved fewer but better monitored animals and have sometimes employed techniques to improve site fidelity and survival. In Pennsylvania, for example, pregnant female American black bears were successfully translocated from winter dens, the premise being that the adult females would be less likely to return because of the presence of young cubs. That winter-release technique was compared to summer trapping and release in Tennessee; winter releases resulted in greater survival and reduced post-release movements. Homing has not been a problem for small numbers of brown bears (Ursus arctos) reintroduced to the Cabinet-Yaak ecosystem in Montana and Idaho and to the mountains of Austria and France. Reintroduction success appearsto be correlated with translocation distance and is greater for subadults and females. As with any small population, reintroduced bear populations are susceptible to environmental variation and stochastic demographic and genetic processes. Although managers have focused on these biological barriers, sociopolitical impediments to bear reintroduction are more difficult to overcome. Poor public acceptance and understanding of bears are the main reasons some reintroduction programs have been derailed. Consequently, the public should be more involved in the reintroduction process from the outset; overcoming negative public perceptions about bear reintroduction will be our greatest challenge.",

	abstract = "We reviewed 180 case studies and a number of theoretical papers on animal relocations published in 12 major international scientific journals over the last 20 years. The study focused on re-introductions, supplementations and translocations (sensu IUCN, 1996. IUCN/SSC Guidelines for Re-introductions. 41st Meeting of the IUCN Council, Gland, Switzerland, May 1995. Http://iucn.org/themes/ssc/pubs/policy/hinte.htm.). We did not assess introductions. Re-introductions were the most common type of relocation (116/180); three quarters of these were conducted for conservation purposes. Supplementations (48/180) and translocations (36/180) occurred less frequently, and both were commonly carried out for reasons other than conservation. Simple descriptive statistics were used to analyse factors influencing relocation success. Translocations that aimed to solve human-animal conflicts generally failed. Re-introduction success was not found to have changed over the last two decades, but re-introductions appeared to be more successful when the source population was wild, a large number of animals was released (n>100), and the cause of original decline was removed. More complex trends were found for the effect of predation and the use of supportive measures such as provision of food or shelter, or predator control prior to release. The success of 47\% of re-introductions was uncertain at the time case studies were published in journals. This was partly due to the lack of generally accepted and widely applied criteria to assess success. Very few case studies (3\%) reported the cost of the relocation attempt. We conclude that there were three primary aims for animal relocations. These were to solve human-animal conflicts, to restock game populations, and conservation. Our extensive review of the present literature leads us to conclude that the value of animal relocations as a conservation tool could be enhanced through (1) more rigorous testing for the appropriateness of the approach in a given case, (2) the establishment of widely used and generally accepted criteria for judging the success or failure of relocations, (3) better monitoring after a relocation, (4) better financial accountability, and (5) greater effort to publish the results of relocations, even ones that are unsuccessful.",

Nevertheless, research thus far has been fragmented and ad hoc, rather than an organized attempt to gain reliable knowledge to improve reintroduction success. We reviewed 454 recent (1990--2005) peer-reviewed papers dealing with wildlife reintroductions from 101 journals. Most research has been retrospective, either opportunistic evaluations of techniques or general project summaries, and most inference is gained from post hoc interpretation of monitoring results on a species-by-species basis. Documentation of reintroduction outcomes has improved, however, and the derivation of more general principles via meta-analyses is expected to increase. The fragmentation of the reintroduction literature remains an obstacle. There is scope to improve reintroduction biology by greater application of the hypothetico-deductive method, particularly through the use of modeling approaches and well-designed experiments. Examples of fruitful approaches in reintroduction research include experimental studies to improve outcomes from the release of captive-bred animals, use of simulation modeling to identify factors affecting the viability of reintroduced populations, and the application of spatially explicit models to plan for and evaluate reintroductions. We recommend that researchers contemplating future reintroductions carefully determine a priori the specific goals, overall ecological purpose, and inherent technical and biological limitations of a given reintroduction and that evaluation processes incorporate both experimental and modeling approaches. We suggest that the best progress will be made when multidisciplinary teams of resource managers and scientists work in close collaboration and when results from comparative analyses, experiments, and modeling are combined within and among studies.",

	abstract = "The responsiveness of South African fauna to climate change events is poorly documented and not routinely incorporated into regional conservation planning. We model the likely range alterations of a representative suite of 179 animal species to climate change brought about by the doubling of CO2 concentrations. This scenario is expected to cause a mean temperature increase of 2`C. We applied a multivariate climate envelope approach and evaluated model performance using the most comprehensive bird data set. The results were encouraging, although model performance was inconsistent in the eastern coastal area of the country. The levels of climate change induced impacts on species ranges varied from little impact to local extinction. Some 17\% of species expanded their ranges, 78\% displayed range contraction (4±98\%), 3\% showed no response and 2\% became locally extinct. The majority of range shifts (41\%) were in an easterly direction, reflecting the east-west aridity gradient across the country. Species losses were highest in the west. Substantially smaller westward shifts were present in some eastern species. This may reflect a response to the strong altitudinal gradient in this region, or may be a model artifact. Species range change (composite measure reflecting range contraction and displacement) identified selected species that could act as climate change indicator taxa. Red-data and vulnerable species showed similar responses but were more likely to display range change (58\% vs. 43\% for all species). Predictions suggest that the flagship, Kruger National Park conservation area may loose up to 66\% of the species included in this analysis. This highlights the extent of the predicted range shifts, and indicates why conflicts between conservation and other land uses are likely to escalate under conditions of climate change.",

Functional programs deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of procedure declarations to become generally applicable. Combining forms can use high level programs to build still higher level ones in a style not possible in conventional languages. Associated with the functional style of programming is an algebra of programs whose variables range over programs and whose operations are combining forms. This algebra can be used to transform programs and to solve equations whose "unknowns" are programs in much the same way one transforms equations in high school algebra. These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in which programs are written. Combining forms are chosen not only for their programming power but also for the power of their associated algebraic laws. General theorems of the algebra give the detailed behavior and termination conditions for large classes of programs. A new class of computing systems uses the functional programming style both in its programming language and in its state transition rules. Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems have semantics loosely coupled to states--only one state transition occurs per major computation.},

Based on this information, as well as the present distribution of mammals and the present environmental conditions within and surrounding the Complex, it makes recommendations for the re-introduction and enhancement of large mammal populations. The following patterns emerge: • Some 14 species known to have occurred in the immediate GFRCC region were locally extinct (some have subsequently been reintroduced, but remain at extremely low numbers). Nine of these were considered to be ``not uncommon'' to "comon", i.e. Spotted Hyaena, Lion, African Elephant, Black Rhinoceros, Burchell{\rq}s Zebra, Giraffe, Blue Wildebeest, Red Hartebeest and Buffalo. The Zebra, Wildebeest, Hartebeest and Buffalo probably moved extensively on a seasonal basis, depending on local rainfall. A further three species apparently occurred less commonly: Wild Dog, White Rhinoceros and Eland. • Most other species have declined in numbers, some dramatically, e.g. Aardworf, Brown Hyaena, Cheetah, Leopard, Caracal, Bat-eared Fox, Black-backed Jackal, Hartmann{\rq}s Mountain Zebra, Springbok, Gemsbok and Kudu. In some areas, as a result of protection and careful management, some of these species have started to recover, e.g. Bat-eared Fox, Hartmann{\rq}s Mountain Zebra, Springbok, Gemsbok and Kudu, • Perhaps two species have increased: Chacma Baboon -- because of access to artificial water points, and Rock Dassie -- because of persecution of their main predators, the Black Eagle and the Caracal.},

The Namibian endemic mammal fauna is characterized by the monotypic Petromuridae, and the rodent genera Gerbillurus and Petromyscus.

Approximately 50\% of all Namibian mammal species are provisionally listed as `secure'. However, due to patchy data, 94 species (38\%) are classi®ed as under possible or probable threat. Nineteen species (8\%) are classified as under definite threat. Over 13\% of Namibia is set aside by the state for conservation purposes. Ninety-five percent of mammal species occur in at least one park, over 80\% occur in three or more parks, and 59 species (28\%) occur in ten or more parks, although for most species nothing is known of their population viability there.

Characteristics considered were: initial population size; presence of cheetah and leopard; area; habitat type; occurrence within the historical range of the subspecies and occurrence of trophy hunting. Success of translocations was described by whether the population had a positive growth rate. The success rate of translocations of black-faced impala (62\%) was higher than shown in other studies of vertebrate translocations. Initial population size was paramount to the success of translocations. Releases of larger populations were more likely to lead to positive population growth rates than were releases of small populations. The presence of cheetah also in��fluenced the success of translocated populations. In the presence of cheetah, small populations translocated to game farms were signi��ficantly less likely to be viable than larger populations.

The aim of this study was to investigate the reproductive ecology of Aloe plicatilis, a Cape fynbos tree aloe endemic to the Cape Winelands, South Africa. Results from a pollinator exclusion experiment conducted at an A. plicatilis population on Paarl mountain suggests pollination primarily by insects, although bird visitation signi��ficantly increased seed set/fruit indicating possible co-pollination with insects. The species' long-tubed ��flowers and production of concentrated nectar, with observations of malachite sunbirds as the most common avian visitors to A. plicatilis ��flowers indicate the importance of long-billed specialist avian nectarivores as ��floral visitors. Analysis of the relationship between plant size and in��florescence production for ��five populations combined revealed a signi��ficant, positive linear relationship between plant size and the logarithm of the number of in��florescences/plant. Natural fruit and seed set determined for three populations (1325, 27,930 and 251,616 seeds/population) suggests low reproductive output compared to several other Aloe species. The smallest (31 individuals) and least dense (75 plants/ha) A. plicatilis population produced the lowest seed set/plant (128 seeds) and per population (1325 seeds), suggesting an Allee effect. Evaluation of seed dispersal potential showed that potential dispersal distances were approximately three times the canopy height; however, the occurrence of A. plicatilis on mountains isolated from more continuous mountain ranges on which the species also occurs suggests the possibility of long-distance dispersal by strong, gusty, summer winds. Soil seed bank samples collected from 13 populations yielded close to zero seedling emergence, indicating the absence of persistent seed banks. A. plicatilis seeds stored under ambient laboratory conditions for 3, 18 and 24 months were germinated in an environmental control chamber and a laboratory. High percentage germination was recorded for 18- and 24-month-seed (86 and 80\%, respectively), while germination of 3-month-old seeds was three times lower, suggesting the need for after-ripening. Germination of fresh and one-year-old seed under ambient nursery conditions at the Karoo Desert National Botanical Garden in Worcester yielded emergence percentages of 67 and 44\%, respectively, and were therefore less successful than germination under more controlled conditions. This is the ��first known study to investigate the reproductive ecology of a tree aloe species and that of a Cape fynbos aloe.

@article{Caughley_1994,
	abstract = "1. Conservation biology has two threads: the small-population paradigm which deals with the effect of smallness on the persistence of a population, and the declining-population paradigm which deals with the cause of smallness and its cure. 2. The processes relevant to the small-population paradigm are amenable to theoretical examination because they generalize across species and are subsumed by an inclusive higher category: stochasticity. 3. In contrast, the processes relevant to the declining-population paradigm are essentially humdrum, being not one but many. So far they have defied tight generalization and hence are of scant theoretical interest. 4. The small-population paradigm has not yet contributed significantly to conserving endangered species in the wild because it treats an effect (smallness) as if it were a cause. It provides an answer only to a trivial question: how long will the population persist if nothing unusual happens? Rather, its major contribution has been to captive breeding and to the design of reserve systems. 5. The declining-population paradigm, on the other hand, is that relevant to most problems of conservation. It summons an investigation to discover the cause of the decline and to prescribe its antidote. Hence, at least at our current level of understanding, it evokes only an ecological investigation which, although utilizing the rigour of tight hypotheses and careful experimentation, is essentially a one-off study of little theoretical interest. 6. The principal contribution of the small-population paradigm is the theoretical underpinning that it imparted to conservation biology, even though most of that theory presently bears tenuous relevance to the specific problems of aiding a species in trouble. It would contribute immeasurably more if some of the theoretical momentum so generated were channelled into providing a theory of driven population declines, thereby liberating the declining-population paradigm from the inefficiency of case-by-case ecological investigations and recovery operations. 7. The declining-population paradigm is urgently in need of more theory. The small-population paradigm needs more practice. Each has much to learn from the other. A cautious intermixing of the two might well lead to a reduction in the rate at which species are presently going extinct.",

	abstract = "The impact of predation on prey populations has long been a focus of ecologists, but a firm understanding of the factors influencing prey selection, a key predictor of that impact, remains elusive. High levels of variability observed in prey selection may reflect true differences in the ecology of different communities but might also reflect a failure to deal adequately with uncertainties in the underlying data. Indeed, our review showed that less than 10\% of studies of European wolf predation accounted for sampling uncertainty. Here, we relate annual variability in wolf diet to prey availability and examine temporal patterns in prey selection; in particular, we identify how considering uncertainty alters conclusions regarding prey selection. Over nine years, we collected 1,974 wolf scats and conducted drive censuses of ungulates in Alpe di Catenaia, Italy. We bootstrapped scat and census data within years to construct confidence intervals around estimates of prey use, availability and selection. Wolf diet was dominated by boar (61.563.90 [SE] \% of biomass eaten) and roe deer (33.763.61\%). Temporal patterns of prey densities revealed that the proportion of roe deer in wolf diet peaked when boar densities were low, not when roe deer densities were highest. Considering only the two dominant prey types, Manly{\rq}s standardized selection index using all data across years indicated selection for boar (mean = 0.7360.023). However, sampling error resulted in wide confidence intervals around estimates of prey selection. Thus, despite considerable variation in yearly estimates, confidence intervals for all years overlapped. Failing to consider such uncertainty could lead erroneously to the assumption of differences in prey selection among years. This study highlights the importance of considering temporal variation in relative prey availability and accounting for sampling uncertainty when interpreting the results of dietary studies.",

The most common cause of death for working dogs, especially young ones, was accidental, which accounted for 22 reported deaths, while culling of the dog by the owner was the reason for 12 working dog deaths, all of which occurred on commercial ranches. The mean survival time as a working dog was estimated as 4.16 (?0.40) years for males, 4.65 (?0.45) years for females, and 4.31 (?0.31) years for all dogs placed.

	abstract = {As a direct result of the general extermination of larger predators such as Lion (Panthera leo) and Brown Hyaena (Hyaena brunnea) in some regions of South Africa, the Black-backed Jackal (Canis mesomelas) and the Caracal or Lynx (Caracal caracal) have become bigger threats to livestock, while smaller carnivores such as genets (Genetta spp.), mongooses (Cynictis spp., Ichneumia spp., Galerella spp. and Paracynictis spp.) and otters (Lutra spp. and Aonyx spp.) cause occasional losses of poultry. Predators and scavengers have long been indiscriminately and unethically persecuted causing the relationships between the predators and their natural prey to be irreparably altered. This forms the basis of South Africa{\rq}s `` damage-causing animal'' situation today. A variety of methods of killing ``problem animals'' are used today including traps, poisons, snares, {\lq}coyote getters{\rq} and other lethal weaponry. These also cause significant mortality amongst non-target species such as the Bat-eared Fox (Otocyon megalotis), Aardwolf (Proteles cristatus), Suricate (Suricata suricatta), many bird species and other small carnivores. The Endangered Wildlife Trust{\rq}s Poison Working Group (PWG) estimates that in excess of 500 000 wild birds and animals die from poisoning alone in South Africa every year. The indiscriminate trapping of animals in gin traps often causing a slow and agonising death and the death of many non-target species, continues in many agricultural areas in South Africa today. This unacceptable situation led to the three host organisation, namely the Endangered Wildlife Trust, CapeNature and the NSPCA to secure the funding to convene this workshop in an attempt to finally develop a coherent, holistic and non-lethal approach to resolving human-wildlife conflict in the agricultural sector in South Africa. Negative attitudes towards carnivores continue to prevail with some species still labelled as {\lq}vermin{\rq}. Conservation authorities must therefore strive to change these attitudes by supplying farmers and landowners with appropriate information, empowering them to employ alternative exclusionary control measures and changing the relevant legislation and regulations. To address this serious situation, the Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (CBSG) Southern Africa, the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT), CapeNature and the National Council of SPCAs jointly convened a national workshop from the 10th -- 13th of April 2006 at the Ganzekraal Conference Centre in the Western Cape entitled: The holistic management of human-wildlife conflict in South Africa. The workshop brought together fifty-five participants from around South Africa representing the farming and agricultural sector, provincial and national conservation authorities, conservation organisations and NGOs, animal welfare organisations, communities and academic institutions. This was an opportunity to share information, to create a better understanding of all components of this contentious issue and attempt to improve current practices by: i. exploring various exclusionary techniques for keeping damage-causing wildlife out of farmland; ii. developing a manual of guidelines for best practice on non-lethal "problem animal" control, so providing preventive measures to farmers and provincial authorities; iii. developing a proposal for a revision of relevant legislation; and iv. exploring the possibility of establishing ethical brands for agricultural products such as beef and mutton, farmed using only ethical predator control or exclusionary methods. An holistic approach must be implemented to address these problems and ``best-practice'' preventative measures should be established to effectively reduce human-wildlife conflict. A preventative approach addresses the problem rather than the ``problem animal''. Three principles therefore underpinned the workshop: Resolving Human-Wildlife Conflict: Prevention is the Cure 2006 i. No species as a whole can be designated as problematic, only specific damage-causing individuals. ii. Prevention has to become the preferred method of conflict management; and lethal and / or injurious techniques to kill or capture wildlife should no longer be promoted or utilised. iii. Overall, the key principle upon which the workshop was convened is that Prevention is the Cure to solving human-wildlife conflict in South Africa. This marks a significant change in attitude and is in-line with new thinking world-wide whereby, environmental issues should be managed within ecological parameters rather than destroying ecological components of ecosystems, which then leads to further and often greater, problems.},

	abstract = "Abstract: Despite the importance of carnivores in terrestrial ecosystems, many nations have implemented well-coordinated, state-funded initiatives to remove predators, largely because of conflicts with humans over livestock. Although these control efforts have been successful in terms of the number of carnivores removed, their effects on the viability of the industries they seek to protect are less understood. I assessed the efficacy of long-term efforts by the U.S. government to improve the viability of the sheep industry by reducing predation losses. I used regression analysis and hierarchical partitioning of a 60-year data set to explore associations among changes in sheep numbers and factors such as predator control effort, market prices, and production costs. In addition, I compared trends in the sheep industry in the western United States, where predator control is subsidized and coyotes (Canis latrans) are abundant, with trends in eastern states that lack federally subsidized predator control and that were (1) colonized by coyotes before 1950 or (2) colonized by coyotes between 1950 and 1990. Although control efforts were positively correlated with fluctuations in sheep numbers, production costs and market prices explained most of the model variation, with a combined independent contribution of 77\%. Trends in sheep numbers in eastern and western states were highly correlated (r ≥ 0.942) independent of the period during which they were colonized by coyotes, indicating either that control has been ineffective at reducing predation losses or that factors other than predation account for the declines in both regions. These results suggest that government-subsidized predator control has failed to prevent the decline in the sheep industry and alternative support mechanisms need to be developed if the goal is to increase sheep production and not simply to kill carnivores.",

	abstract = "The African lion, like other large carnivores, requires vast areas in which to roam. But human expansion and subsequent harassment by people increasingly restricts the lion to protected areas (Mills, 2000) such as national parks, wildlife reserves and hunting areas. In Africa, interactions between humans and large predators are increasing as human occupation of land expands. As might be expected, most such conflicts take place on the periphery of protected areas: cattle herders often penetrate them and new villages tend to be established on their borders, increasing the risk of lion attacks on livestock and people (Bourn and Blench, 1999). To understand lion/human conflicts, therefore, it is necessary to classify the conflicts and assess the extent of damage, and to consider the local context because appropriate solutions will only be found through sound integration of local realities. The causes of conflict need to be analysed (i) to minimize negative man/lion interactions and (ii) to understand the circumstances where no solution exists but a decision has to be made as to which point of view -- the human or the lion -- should prevail. In any case, the interface between humans and wildlife is increasing: growing human population and encroachment into lion habitat have simply augmented the incidence of contact between people and lions. Similarly, the harvesting of wildlife has increased, leaving less natural prey for lions. Obviously, the probability of clashes between people and lions now tends to be higher. Long- established traditional ways of deterring fierce, fully-grown lions might become partly ineffective, and lethal methods are not always acceptable by modern standards. Triggers for human eaters and cattle raiders are being investigated, and knowledge of behavioural factors is improving. New methods to protect people and livestock from lions are being tested in a number of risk situations; these methods are also designed to conserve the lion itself from eradication over its natural range. Conservation of the lion is now a topical concern because our ancestors, the hunted humans (Ehrenreich, 1999) of the past who were chased by predators have become hunting humans and predators themselves.",

	abstract = "One of the greatest challenges in biodiversity conservation today is how to facilitate protection of species that are highly valued at a global scale but have little or even negative value at a local scale. Imperiled species such as large predators can impose significant economic costs at a local level, often in poverty-stricken rural areas where households are least able to tolerate such costs, and impede efforts of local people, especially traditional pastoralists, to escape from poverty. Furthermore, the costs and bene��fits involved in predator conservation often include diverse dimensions, which are hard to quantify and nearly impossible to reconcile with one another. The best chance of effective conservation relies upon translating the global value of carnivores into tangible local bene��fits large enough to drive conservation ``on the ground.'' Although human--carnivore coexistence involves signi��ficant noneconomic values, providing ��financial incentives to those affected negatively by carnivore presence is a common strategy for encouraging such coexistence, and this can also have important bene��fits in terms of reducing poverty. Here, we provide a critical overview of such ��financial instruments, which we term ``payments to encourage coexistence''; assess the pitfalls and potentials of these methods, particularly compensation and insurance, revenue-sharing, and conservation payments; and discuss how existing strategies of payment to encourage coexistence could be combined to facilitate carnivore conservation and alleviate local poverty.",

	abstract = "Farmers have been protecting their livestock for centuries by fencing and kraaling to prevent the risk of losses due to predators. The black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) and the caracal (Caracal caracal) are two important medium-sized predator species among the South African wildlife, but they have a negative impact on the livestock industry in South Africa, especially among sheep and goats. A small number of studies have been done to estimate losses due to predators. Local producer organisations estimated a loss of 8\% of small livestock per year. However, no countrywide study has been done to quantify the monetary impact of predation on the livestock industry. Predation losses are not the only direct economic losses because there are also additional direct and indirect costs involved. The primary objective of this study was to quantify the economic losses due to predation on small livestock and further to analyse the effect of various managerial aspects on the occurrence and level of predation on small livestock farms. The five major small livestock producing provinces (Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Free State, Western Cape and Mpumalanga) were used to collect primary data on predation. Telephonic interviews were used to collect data from 1 424 farmers in the five major small livestock producing provinces. The questionnaire included questions on farm name, location and size, flock size, topography, surrounding land uses, livestock losses due to predators, predator control and various managerial aspects. The majority of losses in these five provinces were small livestock younger than one month, where the black-backed jackal was responsible for the majority of the predation. Losses due to caracal were not as high compared with black-backed jackal. This is mainly ascribed to lower population levels of caracals and also that these damage-causing animals are not found in every region within a province. Losses due to caracal were associated with lambs or kids older than a month, as well as older small livestock. Predation losses due to predators was estimated at R 1 390 453 062 when extrapolating predation losses for the five provinces to the rest of South Africa. The Northern Cape Province reported the highest predation losses, namely R 540 847 496. The reported predation losses for the other four provinces were R 412 810 143 for the EC province, R 247 141 016 for the FS province, R 84 673 440 for the MP province and R 104 980 967 for the WC province. The physical monetary value attached to predation in this study was only the direct cost of predation and do not include indirect cost of controlling damage-causing animals. The monetary losses as presented previously were based on biological information provided by respondents for the five major small livestock producing provinces. For example in the NC province 426 farmers were surveyed, representing 6.9\% of commercial farmers in the province. These farmers were farming on 3 290 790 ha and lost on average 6.14\% of their total small livestock and 13\% of production animals (lambs between 0 -- 6 months). The majority of losses were associated with predation by the black-backed jackal (65\%) and to a lesser extent predation by the caracal (30\%). Other losses experienced on farms were attributed to stock theft (3\%) and vagrant dogs (1\%). There are a number of variables affecting predation in small livestock producing areas in South Africa. These variables differ between provinces according to the main agricultural practices in the area and the management practices used. It was hypothesised that the variables affecting the occurrence of predation and the variables that affected the level of predation was not the same. Therefore, it was necessary to use the Probit and Truncated regression models. It was assumed that factors affecting the occurrence of predation are usually associated with management aspects and normally will be negatively correlated with predation losses. Variables affecting the level of predation can be seen as factors reducing the level of predation and these factors will usually include non-lethal and lethal control methods. The non-lethal control methods usually do not stop predation, but will reduce the level of predation on a farm. However, when success is associated with a certain control method, this variable will be significant in effecting the occurrence of predation on a farm and at a specific point in time. The information collected in this study showed that predation is a serious problem for the South African small livestock sector and there is also no indication that the level of predation is decreasing. This study does not answer all questions on predation, but provides valuable information in understanding the magnitude or extent of predation and some of the factors influencing predation on farms. The information collected can be used to select, evaluate and focus intensively on smaller areas in their efforts to manage predation and develop strategies to reduce the impact.",

@techreport{Linnell_et_al_1996,
	abstract = "This report aims to review individual methods by which the depredation of livestock by carnivores can be reduced, and ways in which these methods can be incorporated into management strategies. An underlying assumption is that joint goals exist of maintaining viable carnivore populations, and livestock production. Data were collected on several related topics including; (1) Carnivore behaviour and ecology, (2) Animal husbandry, (3) Depredation studies, (4) Traditional herding practices, (5) Case studies. A world-wide perspective was taken where possible, although the main emphasis is for Europe, and Scandinavia in particular. Data were gathered from published an unpublished studies and personal communications. A clear effort was made to identify the biological mechanism behind a depredation reduction methods success or failure. Population control of predators has been the most historically favoured method of reducing carnivore depredation on livestock. With abundant species like coyote and dingoes, population reduction through lethal control is still widely used and generally reduces depredation and does not conflict with conservation interests. With large and endangered species widespread population reduction is generally incompatible with carnivore conservation. However, in many cases such species will need to be prevented from colonising areas with unsuitable habitat and very high conflict potential. In general population reduction will only a realistic method if it can be combined with land-use zoning (see later). Although much attention has been directed at removing so-called ``problem individuals'', there is little data to indicate if problem individuals really exist, or if it is a problem sex and age class causing most depredation (males are generally responsible for depredation than females). Much work is needed to determine if these animals exist, and if so, to find ways to identify and selectively remove them. Live-capture and translocation is not considered to be a generally usable method of controlling individual carnivores because of their demonstrated homing ability and their wide post-release movements. Only if large and unsaturated areas exist where the individuals can be released, will there be any measure of success. In general, only when returning breeding age females to very small populations or using an animal for a reintroduction project will the cost of translocation we justified. Many husbandry methods have been used to reduce depredation since livestock were first domesticated 10 000 years ago. Erecting predator-proof fences has been a successful measure used, although large costs and secondary effects on other wildlife imply that is generally only useful to protect small areas, such as bee hives, lambing pastures or night-time enclosures (exceptions exist in Australia and Africa where very large areas are fenced). High-voltage electric fencing has been shown to be most effective. Visual and acoustic repellents, aversive conditioning and the use of other artificial repellents and deterrents have very short-term benefits at best. Increasing natural prey is a prerequisite for reducing depredation and maintaining carnivore populations, but it may also allow carnivore populations to increase so it can not be used independently of other improvements in husbandry. Diversionary feeding of bears may have limited application in some special circumstances, but the problems of having food conditioned bears concentrated around feeding sites can cause a host of other problems, including increased aggression towards humans. Livestock guarding dogs are very effective at reducing depredation when they have a flock or a defined pasture to protect. Removing carrion and carcasses from the pasture may help reduce the number of carnivores attracted to the area. Sheep and goats are much more vulnerable to depredation than cattle. Changing from sheep herding to cattle herding will definitely help reduce depredation, especially when cows with young calves are afforded extra protection. Ensuring that calving and lambing occur under controlled and protected conditions will greatly reduce depredation as it neonates are always vulnerable to more predators than adults. Adjusting birth season so that neonates are larger when released onto open pasture may provide some benefits. Avoiding specific areas and seasons associated with peaks of depredation has the potential to greatly reduce depredation. Paying of compensation does not contribute to a reduction in depredation, it only makes the level of loss more acceptable. In general, it is the traditional methods of caring for livestock which show the greatest promise. The combination of shepherd, guarding dogs and night-time enclosure shows the best promise. The following list provides a summary of the herding systems that show the most promise. In effect these are a return to patterns of husbandry which have been used throughout the Eurasia for millennia. A zoning system implies that sources of conflict are removed from large areas were carnivore populations are conserved, while carnivores are excluded from other areas of unsuitable habitat or very high conflict potential. Many forms of agriculture, forestry, hunting, fishing and industry are compatible with the conservation of carnivores. Free-ranging sheep are the main source of conflict. This means that wilderness is not a prerequisite for effective conservation. Zoning has a sound biological basis in the fidelity to home ranges that most carnivore show. However, the low densities that northern temperate carnivores live at (usually 0.5 - 2.0 individuals per 100 km2) and their large home range sizes (100 - 1000 km2) implies that conservation zones need to be large. Dispersal of juveniles, and occasional extra-territorial movements of adults will cause conflict around the edges of a conservation zone, requiring the use of a large buffer zone. No single measure will reduce depredation on livestock. Zoning of land-use is vital at some level to prevent conflicts between expanding carnivore populations in some areas, and to limit the area in which husbandry measures to reduce depredation need to be applied. A successful strategy for reducing depredation will provide (1) a large area of suitable habitat as a conservation zone from which conflict potential is removed (i.e. greatly improved husbandry or changing to other forms of agriculture), and within which lethal control is not applied. (2) a buffer zone within which improved husbandry is encouraged and lethal control may be practised to prevent, or reduce the colonisation of the area by dispersers. (3) the outside area from which large carnivores will be more or less excluded through lethal control. It is vital that agricultural and environmental management agencies co-operate and co-ordinate their plans so that their joint goals are compatible. Clearly stated goals with a sound scientific basis are a prerequisite for any strategy to work. The importance for constant education and information cannot be overstressed. - Encourage a change from free-ranging sheep and goats to cattle when this is practical. - Changing sheep breed may be effective in some situations. - Ensure that lambing and calving occur under controlled conditions, as long before release onto pasture as possible. - Construct predator-proof night-time enclosures for sheep and cattle with young calves. - To enable sheep to be gathered into a night time enclosure they need to be either; - constantly herded during the day or, - fenced inside a limited area pasture. Electric fences enable this to move as each area is grazed. - Encourage the use of guarding dogs by both day and night. The measures required for night time enclosure also allow guarding dogs to function. - Remove carrion from the pasture when possible. (Vultures?) - Avoid grazing at all, or take most precautions in seasons, habitats or landscapes that have a high depredation risk. - Develop aversive repellents (possibly in connection with protective collars) when lynx and wolverine are the only predators present.",

	abstract = "As the cases in this volume vividly illustrate, human conflict with wildlife is a significant---and growing---conservation problem around the world. The risk of wildlife damage to crops, livestock, and human lives provides incentives for rural residents to kill wildlife and to reduce the quantity and quality of habitat on private and communal lands. Recognition among conservationists that the cost of conserving large and sometimes dangerous animals is often borne disproportionately by farmers and others living closest to wildlife has spawned strategies to reduce this imbalance. One popular response is to compensate rural residents for the costs of wildlife damage. By spreading the economic burden and moderating the financial risks to people who co-exist with wildlife, conservationists hope to reduce the negative consequences of human-wildlife conflict. Few systematic efforts have been made to evaluate the efficacy of these programs or the best way to implement and manage these schemes for endangered species (Sillero-Zubiri \& Laurenson, 2001). In this chapter, we build on our recent study (Nyhus et al., 2003) that asked whether compensation programs really help endangered species in conflict with humans. We surveyed 23 international experts in large mammal conservation to learn about common pitfalls associated with running a compensation program and the resources managers need to succeed. Here, we also draw on additional published studies and reviews to explore the role of compensation in resolving conflicts between people and wildlife. We analyze the prospects and challenges of using these schemes in both developed and developing countries as part of a comprehensive suite of approaches to mitigate the effects of human-wildlife conflict on the long-term survival of endangered species. We also introduce the idea of performance payments and other alternatives to traditional compensation schemes.",

Because cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of cheetahs (Durant 2007). A depleted wild ungulate prey base is of serious concern in northern Africa (Berzins and Belbachir 2006). Cheetahs which turn to livestock are killed as pests (Claro 2003; Hamdine et al. 2003; Wacher et al. 2005). Conflict with farmers and depletion of the wild prey base are also considered significant threats in parts of Eastern Africa (Anon. 2007). In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah A. j. venaticus is threatened indirectly by loss of prey base through human hunting activities. In addition, most protected areas are open to seasonal livestock grazing, which potentially places huge pressure on the resident ungulate populations through disturbance and potential competition (Hunter et al. 2007). Additionally, domestic dogs accompanying the herds present a likely threat to both cheetahs and their prey (H. Ziaie pers. comm. 2008) An emerging threat is the possibility of fragmentation into discontinuous subpopulations as a result of increasing developmental pressures (mining, oil, roads, railways); this is particularly the case in Kavir N.P., currently the north-western limit of the Asiatic Cheetah's range (L. Hunter and L. Marker pers. comm.). Conflict with farmers and ranchers is the major threat to cheetahs in southern Africa (Purchase et al. 2007). Cheetah are often killed or persecuted because they are a perceived threat to livestock, despite the fact that they cause relatively little damage. In Namibia, very large numbers of cheetahs have been live-trapped and removed by ranchers seeking to protect their livestock (from government permit records, Nowell [1996] calculated that over 9,500 cheetahs were removed from 1978-1995). While removal rates have fallen, in part due to intensified conservation and education efforts, many ranchers still view cheetahs as a problem animal, despite research showing that cheetahs were only responsible for 3\% of livestock losses to predators (Marke, 2002). Although cheetah in Iran have been killed because of predation on livestock, since 2003, there has been no direct evidence of killing cheetahs (Hunter et al. 2007), though it is likely most incidents go unreported. Cheetahs are also vulnerable to being caught in snares set for other species (Ray et al. 2005; Anon. 2007). Another threat to the cheetah is interspecific competition with other large predators, especially lions. On the open, short-grass plains of the Serengeti, juvenile mortality can be as high as 95\%, largely due to predation by lions (Laurenson 1994). However, mortality rates are lower in more closed habitats (Caro in press).",

In intact rainforest, the chief threat to Leopards is probably competition with human hunters for prey; the tremendous volume of wild meat harvests denudes forests of prey and may drive localized extinctions. Nonetheless, Leopard are somewhat tolerant of habitat conversion, and may persist close to large human populations provided they have suitable cover and prey (Hunter et al. in press). Leopard come into conflict with people across their range. A rapidly increasing threat to Leopards is the poisoning of carcasses targeting carnivores, either as a means of predator control or incidentally. The impact of trophy hunting on populations is unclear, but may have impacts at the demographic and population level, especially when females are shot. In Tanzania, which allows only males to be hunted, females comprised 28.6\% of 77 trophies shot between 1995 and 1998 (Spong et al. 2000). Skins and canines are still widely traded domestically in some central and West African countries where parts are used in traditional rituals and sold openly in villages and cities (Hunter et al. in press). Djibouti is an important conduit for Leopard skins from East Africa that are bought mainly by French military personnel and carried illegally to Europe. In West Asia, small leopard subpopulations are threatened primarily by habitat fragmentation, killing in defence of livestock, and poaching for trade (Habibi 2004, Breitenmoser et al. 2006, Breitenmoser et al. 2007). In Indo-Malaya, leopards are threatened primarily by habitat loss (deforestation) as well as poaching for illegal trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In India, leopards are feared for their attacks on people (Singh 2005).",

Radio-telemetry assisted in finding five of these cheetah after they had died. Four of the cheetah (57\%) were confirmed to have died of anthrax, whilst the fifth, although not confirmed, possibly also died from anthrax. It is suggested that the susceptibility of cheetah to anthrax is due to their poor immunity due to lack of exposure to anthrax carcasses by being reluctant scavengers. Of seven cheetah tested, only three showed low levels of antibodies to anthrax protective antigen, the others were negative. It is speculated that cheetah are getting the disease through killing animals in the final stages of an anthrax infection.",

	abstract = "Data on the ecology of leopards (Panthera pardus) from north-eastern Namibia are presented and discussed in terms of the possible costs and benefits of solitary behaviour. In an area of low leopard densitym where individuals lived alone, both males and females occupied large home ranges, (ml = 210-1164 km²; fm 183-194 km²). Despite resource and reproductive advantages in maintaining exclusive ranges, the degree of range overlap both between and within sexes was substantial. Average overlap between males was 46\% and between females 35\%. The cost of dispersal appeared high as all three marked sub-adults died, and most recorded mortalities were of sub-adults. Females with dependent young sowed a significant increase in per capita food intake compared to single females and males. Higher foraging success by females with cubs was revealed through two energy expenditure parameters (kg/km travelled/day and kg/hunt/day). Differential food intake between females with cubs, single females and males can be explained partly by differences in day ranges, body size and costs of parental care. Females shared 27\% of their food with cubs and the costs of sharing food does not appear as high as previously suggested. Inter-specific competitionover food and the defence of carcasses is suggested as an important cost to group living. Leopard kills were visited by other large carnivores (12\%), but food loss was minimal (2\%). Leopards successfully avoided conflict with inter-specific competitors by dragging and hiding kills in thick vegetation. We argue that solitary and secretive behaviour enables leopards to avoid the costs of defending carcasses against larger and gregarious carnivores.",

Tracking, the reconstruction of activity from the spoor of animals, is an age-old technique that is still frequently used by modem-day hunted gatherer communities. Although previously used in behavioural studies, tracking has not been tested for its scientific merit. In this paper, we provide data towards such a description by first testing the reliability of tracking, and second attempting to measure the techniques of tracking. In a test for accuracy, the Ju/'Hoan San team was correct in most (98\% of 569) spoor reconstructions. Most significant of these were the correct identification of individually known animals and the reconstruction of complex behaviour from spoor. Measurements of the spoor of different species and age/sex groups in some species showed significant differences. Variation in different soil conditions, however, affected spoor measurements so that subtle differences between individually known animals could not be measured. Measurements of the spacing distances and placement of feet during different gaits gave statistical and schematic values to indicate some of the techniques used by trackers during the reconstruction of behaviour. Indigenous peoples, such as the Ju/'Hoan, have an in-depth knowledge of nature.

The art of tracking may well be the origin of science. Science may have evolved more than a hundred thousand years ago with the evolution of modern hunter-gatherers. Scientific reasoning may therefore be an innate ability of the human mind. This may have far-reaching implications for self-education and citizen science. The implication of this theory is that anyone, regardless of their level of education, whether or not they can read or write, regardless of their cultural background, can make a contribution to science. Kalahari Bushmen trackers have been employed in modern scientific research using GPS-enabled handheld computers and have co-authored scientific papers. Citizen scientists have made fundamental contributions to science. From a simple observation of a bird captured on a smart phone through to a potential Einstein, some may be better than others, but everyone can participate in science. Today humanity is becoming increasingly dependent on science and technology for survival, from our dependence on information technology through to solving problems related to energy production, food production, health, climate change and biodiversity conservation. Involving citizens in science may be crucial for the survival of humanity over the next hundred years. Scientific reasoning was part of hunter-gatherer culture, along with music, storytelling and other aspects of their culture. Science and art should be an integral part of human culture, as it has been for more than a hundred thousand years.",

Apparent competition is an indirect interaction among prey species mediated by a shared predator, and has been increasingly linked to declines of prey species across taxa. We review theoretical and empirical studies of apparent competition, with speci��fic attention to the mechanisms of asymmetry among apparently competing prey species. Asymmetry is theoretically driven by niche overlap, species ��fitness traits, spatial heterogeneity and generalist predator behavior. In real-world systems, human- induced changes to ecosystems such as habitat alteration and introduced species may be ultimate sources of species endangerment. However, apparent competition is shown to be a proximate mechanism when resultant changes introduce or subsidize abundant primary prey for predator populations. Demonstration of apparent competition is dif��ficult due to the indirect relationships between prey and predator species and the potential for concurrent exploitative competition or other community effects. However, general conclusions are drawn concerning the characteristics of prey and predator species likely to exhibit asymmetric apparent competition, and the options for recovering endangered species. While short-term management may be required to avoid imminent extinction in systems demonstrating apparent competition, we propose adaptive conservation efforts directed at long-term recovery.",

Poaching and illegal trade About 1000 farmers determine cheetah survival in Namibia. This document wants to: 1. Identify important components of farming eco-system 2. Determine farming methods that limits livestock losses to predators 3. Suggest conservation strategies that benefit both farmers and cheetahs Few cheetahs survive in conserved areas because of competition with large predators, in particular lions and hyaenas. CITES data shows that cheetahs were removed regardless of whether they cause livestock losses or not. 10\% of the world cheetah population lives in captivity. Number of deaths more than births, although captive population has grown through import of wild animals. Cattle farming 87\% of agricultural income. 51\% of land can be used for larg livestock and 33\% for small livestock. 6000 commercial farms use 44\% of available farmlands in Namibia. About 70\% of Nambian huntable game and 90\% of cheetah habitat and range are on commercial land in private ownership. About N$6.4 million from trophy hunting. Reduction in biodiversity through: 1. Bush encroachment 2. Removal of wild species 3. Over-use of game Because of extensive farming methods it was impractical to protect livestock properly? (water limited and large land areas needed to keep livestock). Permament water led to game staying on farms. Ownership of wildlive given to farm owners in 1967: Kudu, Oryx and springbuck numbers increased with 60% 1960-1973. "Old" MET 1983 reasons for conflict: 1. Strong opinions by farmers on predators 2. Cheetah considered as most important problem animal 3. Cheetahs or their tracks automatically caused them to be blamed for livestock losses 4. Large percentage of calf losses due to natural causes. 5. More research needed Game farming a problem. Cheetahs considered common. Re-introduction to Etosha not successful. CCF did survey 1991-1993 for: 1. Components of eco-system, 2. farming methods, 3. cheetah behaviour. More game: less cheetah problems (p=0,02). More research needed for cattle breeds and predators. Black-backed jackal most common problem animal (65%), caracal (37%), Leopard (33%) and cheetah (25%). Other reasons for losses: snakes, poison, aardvark holes, diseases, infertility, theft. Methods impractical with extensive farming? Game has short, synchronised calving periods. Donkeys works against cheetah, caracal, jackal and dogs (not leopards?). Guidlines for use: Mare, with herd before calving starts, 1 per herd, test its reactions towards predators in kraal with dog, small, open camps with medium size herds. Oxen with horns. Herders and dogs made little difference in small livestock killed by predators! Kraal with thorn bushes. Maintenance needed. Game more difficult. Game farmers (31%) removed more cheetahs (45%) then livestock farmers. Many farmers want to understand behaviour of cheetahs better. Leopards as well as baboons may limit cheetah distribution on farms. Play trees more males than females - reason unclear and more research needed. Play boulders.

	abstract = "As the authors emphasize, even science has greatly lagged in that only a few species, mostly large and easily observed ones, have had long-term studies at certain sites. The status of species throughout their African range remains obscure. Furthermore, studies have concentrated on individual species rather than on whole assemblages or guilds of carnivores inhabiting an area. Such guilds---which may include ten or more species---remain intact in relatively few places, and the authors have provided a significant service to conservation by revealing those and encouraging critical research there. We still know too little about carnivores, about habitat requirements, adaptation to and tolerance of human encroachment, food habits, and interactions with other guild members, to name just four issues. As studies in various parts of the world have shown, carnivores help to structure an ecosystem through their impact on prey and each other and ultimately on the vegetation. Species in crisis: Ethiopian wolf, African wild dog, cheetah, lion Species of concern: leopard, spotted hyena, brown hyena, caracal, serval, golden cat High-profile data-rich species: Cheetah, lion, African wild dog, leopard, spotted hyena Externally threatened, but not highly vulnerable: Cape clawless otter, spotted neck otter, serval, caracal Inherently vulnerable, but with few documented threats: African golden cat, Congo clawless otter, striped hyena, brown hyena Species that thrive in human landscapes: Black-backed jackal, golden jackal, side-striped jackal, African civet. Are these species really ok, or do we just not know? Aardwolf, honey badger In Kruger National Park, the artificial provisioning of water for wildlife from the 1930s onwards may have driven the competition-mediated extirpation of brown hyenas as a breeding species (Mills 2003). Increased water availability resulted in elevated densities of resident prey species and ultimately of lions and spotted hyenas, particularly in more xeric areas (Mills \& Gorman 1997). As relatively visible members of carnivore communities when present, we recommend focusing conservation attention and monitoring efforts on spotted hyenas and/or leopards where: a) lions, cheetahs, wild dogs, and/or brown hyenas are present but critically endangered (although not in expense of attention to those species) or b) following their extirpation (e.g., North Africa and extensive areas in West Africa). Africa presents extraordinary opportunities for conducting multi-species research and conservation efforts on carnivores, yet the majority of projects remain focused on single species. Funding, manpower, and logistical restrictions remain constraints for any individual researcher, team or project yet significant benefits can accrue simply from greater coordination between researchers in a region. Even with the large number of research papers devoted to carnivores, there remain very few that evaluate and address the impacts of threats to multiple species in a region. Recent examples of data-sharing and coordinated analysis from North America (e.g. Ruth et al. 2003) represent a valuable model.",

	abstract = "The cheetah lineage is a group of large, slender, and long-limbed cats with a distinctive skull and dental morphology, of which only the extant cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is present today. The lineage is characterized by having abbreviated, tall, and domed crania, and a trenchant dentition with a much reduced, posteriorly placed protocone on the upper carnassial. In this article, we report on a new discovery of a Late Pliocene specimen from China with an estimated age of ≈2.2--2.5 million years, making it one of the oldest specimens known to date. A cladistic analysis confirmed that it is the most primitive cheetah known, and it shares a number of unambiguous derived cranial traits with the Acinonyx lineage, but has more primitive dentition than previously known cheetahs, demonstrating that the many unusual skull and dental characters hitherto considered characteristic of cheetahs evolved in a gradual fashion. Isolated teeth of primitive cheetahs may not be recognizable as such, but can be confused with, for instance, those of leopards or other similar-sized pantherine cats or pumas. The age and morphology of the new specimen supports an Old World origin of the cheetah lineage, not a New World one, as has been suggested. We name the new species Acinonyx kurteni in honor of the late Bj{\"o}rn Kurt{\'e}n. Acinonyx Miracinonyx Felidae morphology systematics The cheetah lineage (Acinonyx sp.) is a group of large, long-limbed felids with small, domed skulls, which lived in open habitats across much of Eurasia in the Late Pliocene-Pleistocene, of which only the species Acinonyx jubatus is present today (1⇓--3). Acinonyx jubatus is an unusual type of felid with a distinct craniodental and skeletal morphology, and, uniquely among felids, it is anatomically adapted for high-speed pursuit in open landscapes (3⇓⇓⇓--7). Cheetahs are now found almost exclusively on the African grasslands and semideserts (3, 7, 8), but they used to be present in open-forest type habitats in Asia before being exterminated by humans (3, 6, 9). Cheetahs are usually rare in fossil assemblages and are most often found as isolated fragmentary specimens (2, 10⇓--12). In the Plio-Pleistocene of North America, another lineage of cheetah-like cats (Miracinonyx sp.) was present, which also had long limbs and small, tall and abbreviated skull shapes (2, 13). Remains of cheetahs and cheetah-like cats are known from the Late Pliocene (early Villafranchian) to the Late Pleistocene of Africa and Eurasia (Acinonyx sp.), and North America (Miracinonyx sp.), but complete skulls are very rare and are only known for derived species such as the Late Pleistocene Miracinonyx trumani (13), and the giant Eurasian cheetah Acinonyx pardinensis from the middle-late Villafranchian (1, 14). Although larger, the latter is morphologically very similar to the extant cheetah, and both species are derived members of the cheetah lineage, whereas more primitive members of this lineage are very poorly known, making hypotheses on the evolution of the many unusual characters in the skull, mandible and dentition tentative. In this article, we present a new discovery from the Late Pliocene of China of a new species of primitive cheetah, whose skull shows a unique combination of primitive and derived characters, and demonstrates gradual evolution of the many derived craniodental traits considered characteristic of cheetah lineage, thus shedding new light on the early evolution of the cheetah lineage. The dentition is far more primitive than in all other cheetah-like cats, raising doubts on the identification of isolated dental finds of large cats from the Pliocene-Pleistocene of Eurasia and Africa, which are often attributed to leopards.",

	abstract = "In South Africa there are efforts to manage reintroduced subpopulations of the vulnerable cheetah Acinonyx jubatus in small reserves (10--1,000 km2) as a managed metapopulation. We estimated areas required to support cheetahs given varying prey densities, prey pro��files and presence/absence of competing predators. A recent population and habitat viability assessment indicated that 20 subpopulations of 10 cheetahs or 10 subpopulations of 15 cheetahs are required to retain 90\% of the heterozygosity of free-ranging cheetahs and to overcome stochastic events in the absence or presence of lions Panthera leo, respectively. We estimate that 203 -- SE 42 km2 (range 48--466 km2) is required to support 10 cheetahs in the absence of lions, whereas 703 -- SE 311 km2 (166--2,806 km2) is required to support 15 cheetahs given equal numbers of lions, and 2,424 -- SE 890 km2 (727--3,739 km2) given equal numbers of leopards Panthera pardus, spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta, wild dogs Lycaon pictus and lions. Existing subpopulations of cheetahs generally occur at densities higher than our mean predicted densities but usually within the range of predicted densities. The large area requirements of cheetahs have implications for the development of the managed metapopulation. Sourcing reintroduction sites of the sizes required to support recommended subpopulation sizes will be dif��ficult. Consequently, innovative measures to increase the carrying capacity of reserves for cheetahs and/or to enlarge reserves will be required. Managers may be forced to stock cheetahs close to or beyond the carrying capacity of their reserves. Consequently, careful management of reintroduced subpopulations will be required to prevent declines in prey populations.

Using grounded theory, 43 members of commercial conservancies were surveyed to identify themes in the practice and perception of sustainable utilisation. While basic tourism was infrequent, trophy hunting was a common source of revenue from wildlife. Three emergent themes from the data included differences in tourist versus hunting operations; attitudes and perceptions of the administration of conservation efforts; and the co-management of livestock and wildlife, especially farm economics and game-proof fencing. Overall, increases in the proportion of income derived from game (above 20\% of farm revenue) were associated with concurrent reductions in domestic livestock, but did not increase the use of game-proof fences.

Grassland restoration efforts have been directed at controlling creosotebush by applying herbicide over large spatial scales. However, we have a limited understanding of how landscape-scale restoration affects biodiversity. We examined whether restoration treatments in southern New Mexico, USA have in��fluenced the community structure of lizards, which are sensitive to shrub encroachment. We compared lizard community structure on 21 areas treated with herbicide from 7 to 29 years ago with paired untreated areas that were dominated by shrubs and matched by geomorphology, soils, and elevation. To examine mechanisms underlying responses to restoration, we tested whether the abundance of a grassland specialist, Aspidoscelis uniparens, depended on time since treatment, treatment area and isolation, and local habitat quality. Because lizards use rodent burrows as habitat, we tested whether community structure and A. uniparens abundance depended on the abundance of the keystone rodent, Dipodomys spectabilis. Treated areas had reduced shrub cover and increased grass cover compared to untreated areas. Lizard community composition differed strongly between areas, with four species responding to treatments. Divergence in community composition between treated--untreated pairs was greatest for old treatments (C22 years), and community composition was in��fluenced by D. spectabilis. In particular, the abundance of A. uniparens was greatest on old treatments with a high density of D. spectabilis. Overall, our results demonstrate lizard community structure responds to grassland restoration efforts, and keystone species can shape restoration outcomes.

	abstract = "Conservation translocation is the deliberate movement of organisms from one site for release in another. It must be intended to yield a measurable conservation benefit at the levels of a population, species or ecosystem, and not only provide benefit to translocated individuals. Conservation translocations - Figure 1 - consist of (i) reinforcement and reintroduction within a species{\rq} indigenous range, and (ii) conservation introductions, comprising assisted colonisation and ecological replacement, outside indigenous range. Translocation is an effective conservation tool but its use either on its own or in conjunction with other conservation solutions needs rigorous justification. Feasibility assessment should include a balance of the conservation benefits against the costs and risks of both the translocation and alternative conservation actions. Risks in a translocation are multiple, affecting in many ways the focal species, their associated communities and ecosystem functions in both source and destination areas; there are also risks around human concerns. Any proposed translocation should have a comprehensive risk assessment with a level of effort appropriate to the situation. Where risk is high and/or uncertainty remains about risks and their impacts, a translocation should not proceed. Translocations of organisms outside of their indigenous range are considered to be especially high risk given the numerous examples of species released outside their indigenous ranges subsequently becoming invasive, often with massively adverse impacts. Any translocation will impact and be impacted by human interests. Social, economic and political factors must be integral to translocation feasibility and design. These factors will also influence implementation and often require an effective, multi-disciplinary team, with technical and social expertise representing all interests. Design and implementation of conservation translocations should follow the standard stages of project design and management, including gathering baseline information and analysis of threats, and iterative rounds of monitoring and management adjustment once the translocation is underway - Figure 2. This ensures that process and progress are recorded; changes in translocation objectives or management regime can then be justified, and outcomes can be determined objectively. Finally, translocations should be fully documented, and their outcomes made publicly and suitably available to inform future conservation planning.",

Limit theorems are proved both for the conditional distributions under the hypothesis of randomness and under general contiguous alternatives with independent but not identically distributed observations. The proofs are based on results on limit theorems for exchangeable random variables by Strasser and Weber, [20]. The limit theorems under contiguous alternatives are consequences of a LAN-result for likelihood ratios of symmetrized product measures. The results of the paper have implications for statistical applications. By example it is shown that minimum variance partitions which are de��fined by observed data (e.g. by LVQ) lead to asymptotically optimal adaptive tests for the k-sample problem.

The methodology is a systematic collation of various design approaches and concepts, which were examined during the ongoing design and field trial exercises related to remotely controlled airships and aerostats at the Lighter-Than-Air Systems Laboratory of IIT Bombay. A methodology for arriving at the size of fins from static stability considerations is presented, which includes determination of tether profile. The various design decisions were driven by the availability of local materials for different components.This paper outlines a Multi-disciplinary Optimization approach for identifying the optimum shape of an aerostat envelope that results in the largest payload capacity for a given envelope volume. Apart from aerodynamics, the participating disciplines in this optimization problem are flight mechanics and structures. Some constraints that take into consideration the difficulty in fabrication of certain kinds of shapes have also been included. A shape generation algorithm for parameterization of a general envelope shape in terms of standard geometrical surfaces is then described. The problem is posed in an optimization framework and optimum shapes are obtained using Genetic Algorithms. Results for an aerostat of envelope volume of 2000 m3 reveal that the payload capacity of the optimum shape of single fabric construction is ~ 2.2 \% higher compared to a similar envelope using the standard GNVR shape. However, use of multi-fabric construction was seen to increase the payload capacity by ~ 22\% for both the GNVR and optimum shape. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the payload capacity decreases considerably with increase in fabric density, and tether weight per unit length due to increased self weight, and angle of attack. It was also seen that the fin weight and the location of confluence point depend to a great extent, on the location of CG.

The system consists of a microprocessor-controlled radio-frequency monitor equipped with advanced signal-processing capabilities that communicates with, and relays information to, a user interface unit at a different location. The system was designed for a capture-and-release snow leopard (Panthera uncia) study in Mongolia, where checking trap-site transmitters manually entailed climbing a hill with telemetry equipment several times each day and night. Here, it monitors the trapsite transmitters and actively produces an alarm when any of the traps have been triggered, or if the system has lost contact with any trap-transmitter. The automated system allowed us to constantly monitor transmitters from a research camp, and alerted us each time a trap was triggered. The system has been ��field-tested for 83 days from mid-September 2010 to mid-December 2010 in the Tost mountain range on the edge of Mongolia{\rq}s Gobi desert. During this time, the system performed reliably, responding correctly to 45 manually generated alarms and 9 animal captures. The system considerably shortens the time the captured animals spend in traps, and also mitigates the need for manual trap-site transmitter monitoring, greatly reducing risk to the animal and the human effort involved.",

The key issue addressed is a distortion robust detection and comparison of unique, deforming camouflage markings as found in a wide range of species. We propose a coarse-to-fine methodology specifically extending and combining vision techniques in a three-stage approach, that is 1) a rapid, coarse key-view detection based on patch appearance, 2) pose estimation and 3D model fitting using a (pre-computed) dynamic Feature Prediction Tree (FPT) followed by bundle adjustment and 3) texture back-projection, extraction of unique phase singularities and final encoding using an extended variant of Shape Contexts [2]. Distortion-robust animal identification is then achieved by solving associated bipartite graph matching tasks for pairs of templates. Experimental results indicate a performance of GAR 92\% at FAR 10−1 \% for a prototype trained on non-occluded African penguins operating in a real-world animal colony of thousands. Independently producing time-stamped identification data, the system marks a first step towards a partial automation of biological field observations that may permit for a truly non-intrusive behavioural as well as conservational analysis of population dynamics.",

@phdthesis{Burghardt_2008,
	abstract = "The ��field of computer vision has repeatedly been recognised as an intellectual frontier whose boundaries of applicability are yet to be stipulated. This thesis explores one novel application: visual animal biometrics. The work demonstrates that vision can achieve an automatic identi��fication of animals ��filmed in their natural habitat. The thesis proposes and evaluates algorithms for detecting a species and -- in the case that the animals carry Turing patterns -- for recognising individuals in visual material comprising various poses, changing lighting and clutter. Lions, plains zebras and African penguins serve as sample species to showcase the di�fferent capabilities and limitations of the approach. First, an algorithmic framework for species recognition is discussed. In particular, it is shown that the appearance context of a number of reference points on coat patterns contains a species-speci��fic component, which can be utilised for achieving a robust detection of the investigated animal specimens. The proposed model employs boosted point-surround classi��fiers as local appearance descriptors. Second, it is illustrated how pose-normalised texture maps of Turing-patterned coat regions can be extracted based on the extracted reference points. The maps are shown to contain individually-speci��fic features which -- using an extension of shape contexts -- can be represented as deformation-robust sets of histograms. Finally, it is discussed how distance measures can be used for comparing these sets with population databases to retrieve animal identities. In order to provide a practical proof of concept, a prototype system was tested in a colony of African penguins and in a preliminary study on a photo collection of plains zebras. The results indicate a system performance that allows for disambiguating individuals with a level of con��fidence suﬃcient for tasks of population monitoring. This outcome marks a promising ��first step towards an automated, truly non-invasive observation of wild animal populations, which would bene��fit ��field-based biology and assist the conservation of species in decline.",

	abstract = "1. Compared to traditionalradio-collars,global positioning system (GPS) collars provide finer spatial resolution and collect locations across a broader range of spatial and temporal conditions. However,data from GPS collars are biased because vegetation and terrain interfere with the satellite signals necessary to acquire a location. Analyses of habitat selection generally proceed without correcting for this known sampling bias. We documented the effects of bias in resource selection functions (RSF) and compared the effectiveness of two bias-correction techniques. 2. The effects of environmental conditions on the probability of a GPS collar collecting a location were modelled for three brands of collar using data collected in 24-h trials at 194 test locations. The best-supported model was used to create GPS-biased data from unbiased animal locations. These data were used to assess the effects of bias given data losses in the range of 10-40\% at both 1- and 6-h sampling intensities. We compared the sign, value and significance of coefficients derived using biased and unbiased data. 3. With 6-h locations we observed type II errorrates of 30-40\% given as little as a 10\% data loss. Biased data also produced coefficients that were significantly more negative than unbiased estimates. Increasing the sampling intensity from 6- to 1-h locations eliminated type II errors but increased the magnitude of coefficient bias. No type I errors or changes in sign were observed. 4. We applied sample weighting and iterative simulation given a 30\% data loss. For a biased vegetation type, simulation reduced more type II errors than weighting, most probably because the original sample size was re-established. However, selection for areas near trails, which was influenced by a biased vegetation type, showed fewer type II errors after weighting existing animal locations than after simulation. Both techniques corrected 100\% and >= 80\%of the biased coefficients at the 6- and 1-h sampling intensities, respectively. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that GPS error is predictable and biases the coefficients of resource selection models dependant upon the GPS sampling intensity and the level of data loss. We provide effective alternatives for correcting bias and discuss applying corrections under different sampling designs.",

Some farmers and problem animal hunters have already come to the conclusion that the unselective removal of jackal often leads to more damage (de Wet 2002, Genis 2006, S. de Beer, M. le Roux, K. Louw, R. Wilke personal communication), while we expect it also to lead to increased compensatory breeding and immigration. A number of other factors suggest that we should investigate the same hypothesis that will be tested for managing caracal. For example, in conservation areas the ranging and reproductive behavior of black-backed jackal is influenced by the abundance and distribution of prey (Bernard and Stuart 1987, Kaunda and Skinner 2003, Loveridge and MacDonald 2003), and heaviest stock losses due to jackal occur during times of low natural prey density (Nel 1984b, Avenant unpublished results). Avenant (2000, 2003, 2005), Avenant and Cavallini (2007) and Avenant et al. (In press) regarded the study of small mammal community structure as a very effective, practical and relatively inexpensive tool for wildlife managers and environmental consultants to describe and monitor ecosystems and habitat integrity. During the CCP, small mammals will, therefore, also be sampled as part of a monitoring program that will assess the influence of various predator control and farming practices on ecosystem structure and functioning. We hypothesize that a higher diversity of small mammals and securing dominant, territorial caracal individuals or black-backed jackal pairs over a large area may help to curb stock losses. However, the profitability of such a cut can only be evaluated once the costs of initial losses and current control measures have been substantiated. The indirect costs of {\lq}{\lq}unstable{\rq}{\rq}, non-resilient and non- resistant ecosystems (e.g., rodent outbreaks, sickness, and increased numbers of hyrax competing with small stock for food) and the South African government{\rq}s obligation to conserve biodiversity should also be considered.",

The feeding habits of caracal in different areas varied, according to abundance and occurrence of prey species. Captive animals required an average of 586g of meat each day. Killing techniques varied for different sized prey items. Physical and behavioural ontogeny are described for captive born animals. A technique for determining age of F. caracal was developed from study of known-age captive caracal. Examination of females killed in the wild, captive births, and births which were back-dated indicated that although young were born throughout the year, there was a definite birth peak between October and February with the lowest point being in May/June. Caracal were distinctly sexually dimorphic in size. Six F. caracal (four females and two males) were trapped, fitted with radio-transmitters, and released at the capture sites. Animals were cumulatively tracked for a total of 164 weeks. The mean range was 24,16km2• A young adult male covered approximately 138km before settling in a 48km2 area.

We propose a patented* Wingless Electromagnetic Air Vehicle (WEAV), which employs no moving parts and assures near instantaneous response time. For the first time, the aircraft structure, propulsion, energy production and storage, and control will be combined in an integrated system. Such systems will be invaluable in close air support missions by providing situational awareness and damage assessment in a complex and chaotic battlefield environment. If necessary, the vehicle will also be designed to deliver focused and calibrated firepower. It will support AFRL strategic vision of 2015-2030 to ``deliver precision effects: ubiquitous, swarming sensors and shooters'' and will be relevant to the WMD sensing ISR missions. With a flight profile similar to a spinning disk, WEAV will be able to soar for long periods of time and utilize EHD thrust to acquire and maintain desired altitude and attitude. This revolutionary concept is based on the use of an electro-(or magneto) hydrodynamic (EHD/MHD) thrust generation surface that is coated with multiple layers of dielectric polymers with exposed and/or embedded electrodes for propulsion and dynamic control. This technology has the unique capability of imparting an accurate amount of thrust into the surrounding fluid enabling the vehicle to move and react. Thrust is instantaneously and accurately controlled by the applied power, its waveform, duty cycle, phase lag and other electrical parameters. Once the applied power is removed the thrust vanishes. Combining the EHD/MHD technology with emerging batteries and thin-film photovoltaics provides both energy source and storage in the same structure. The goal of this project is the proof-of-concept demonstration of an electromagnetically driven wingless aircraft with no moving component that will be able to selflift, hover and fly reliably especially under gust and impact conditions.",

We have developed a computer vision system that automatically creates a unique biometric identifier for individual adult African penguins Spheniscus demersus using natural markings in the chest plumage and matches this against a population database. We tested this non-invasive system in the field at Robben Island, South Africa. False individual identifications of detected penguins occurred in less than 1 in 10 000 comparisons (n = 73 600, genuine acceptance rate = 96.7\%) to known individuals. The monitoring capacity in the field was estimated to be above 13\% of the birds that passed a camera (n = 1453). A significant increase in this lower bound was recorded under favourable conditions. We conclude that the system is suitable for population monitoring of this species: the demonstrated sensitivity is comparable to computer-aided animal biometric monitoring systems in the literature.

@phdthesis{Markham_2008,
	abstract = "Existing approaches to monitoring wildlife with wireless networks have not taken into account the vast heterogeneity inherent in the Animal Kingdom, especially with respect to bodyweight (and hence tag carrying capacity). This has resulted in a single design of tag which is only suitable for placement on larger animals. Thus, with existing technology, small animals cannot be monitored using the wireless network system. Motivated by the diversity of animals, a hybrid wildlife tracking system, EcoLocate, is proposed, with lightweight VHF-like tags and high performance GPS enabled tags, bound by a common wireless network design. Tags transfer information amongst one another in a multi-hop store-and-forward fashion, and can also monitor the presence of one another, enabling social behaviour studies to be conducted. Information can be gathered from any sensor variable of interest (such as temperature, water level, activity and so on) and forwarded through the network, thus leading to more effective game reserve monitoring. Six classes of tracking tags are presented, varying in weight and functionality, but derived from a common set of code, which facilitates modular tag design and deployment. The link between the tags means that tags can dynamically choose their class based on their remaining energy, prolonging lifetime in the network at the cost of a reduction in function. Lightweight, low functionality tags (that can be placed on small animals) use the capabilities of heavier, high functionality devices (placed on larger animals) to transfer their information. EcoLocate is a modular approach to animal tracking and sensing and it is shown how the same common technology can be used for diverse studies, from simple VHF-like activity research to full social and behavioural research using wireless networks to relay data to the end user. The network is not restricted to only tracking animals -- environmental variables, people and vehicles can all be monitored, allowing for rich wildlife tracking studies. To transfer the obtained data effectively through resource diverse nodes, a network protocol, termed the Adaptive Social Hierarchy (ASH) was designed that ranks nodes according to their resources, such as energy or connectivity. ASH provides a scalable and adaptable method for nodes to discover the role within the network, inspired by the way animals form linear dominance hierarchies through dyadic (pairwise) interactions. Three different methods of forming the social hierarchy are presented. In the ��first method, pairwise ASH, pairs of nodes exchange their attributes and their estimates of rank in a two-way exchange. Although this is a simple method of forming the hierarchy, it does not take advantage of the broadcast nature of the radio channel. In light of this, a one-way method of updating ranks is proposed and shown to be able to estimate the node ranks faster than pairwise ASH, due to multiple nodes receiving the same beacon. However, both methods are unable to form an accurate social hierarchy in a stationary network, due to a limited visibility horizon. It is shown how to extend the horizon by creating pseudo-connections between unconnected nodes, using an agent based approach. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate how the ASH concept can be used as a network underlay to enhance existing protocols or how it can form a cross-layer protocol in its own right. ASH is simple, scalable and has a negligible load on the network as ASH data piggybacks on top of existing network discovery packets. The focus is shifted from the network design to considering how to better schedule location ��fixes for power hungry GPS receivers. Existing wildlife tracking collars acquire ��fixes at constant time intervals. This leads to undersampling of high speed motion, and multiple redundant ��fixes when the animal is stationary. Uniform distance sampling of GPS locations is thus proposed. A low power, neck mounted, accelerometer is used to capture brief acceleration snapshots. An adaptive model, relating the snapshots to host speed is trained when the GPS unit is active. When the GPS receiver is powered down, the model is used to predict the speed of the host, and thus schedule GPS ��fixes at uniform distance intervals. The proposed scheme is implemented on low power 8 bit microcontrollers, and demonstrates that it is able to automatically learn the habits of the host animal or person. This technique can reduce collar power consumption by as much as 50\%, whilst generating more accurate traces than uniform time sampling, as well as creating a detailed speed-time pro��file as a byproduct of the speed estimation process. This work has considered the problem of tracking and monitoring wild animals and their interaction and dependency on their environment. A scalable, modular and adaptable solution has been proposed, that allows small and large animals to be monitored using the same system and which automatically sends data through the network to the end user. Thus, this work has the potential to greatly enhance the understanding of animal behaviour, by providing large amounts of inter-related sensor data with minimal human input.",

The test of the accuracy involved comparing tag locations with contiguous Differential GPS locations under a range of differing conditions. These tests included static tests in both open and occluded conditions, tests where the tag remained static for a long period of time, and tests where the tag was moved to different locations for each iteration of the duty cycle. Results found a mean figure for 28.970m Easting and 37.112m Northing RMSE. Overall tag performance testing resulted in successful GPS fixes being recorded 67\% of the time.",

	abstract = "Khao Yai National Park (KYNP) is well known for its biodiversity and has the potential to serve as a regional model for wildlife conservation. From October 2003 through October 2007, the managers of KYNP conducted a Carnivore Conservation Project to develop and implement long-term monitoring of their large mammal populations. We present these data as an example to demonstrate the usefulness of long-term camera-trapping despite data that cannot be fitted to mark/recapture or occupancy statistical frameworks. Overall, a relatively high number of camera trap photographs was obtained for viverrids (four species; 44 photos) and ursids (two species; 39 photos). However, a relatively low number (range, one to eight) of camera trap photographs was obtained for each of the four felid species and two canid species detected by cameras. Of a total survey effort of 6,260 trap nights, no tigers (Panthera tigris) were detected by camera traps, suggestive of at best a small, non-viable tiger population. Compared to previous camera-trapping efforts at KYNP, we expanded intensive sampling beyond the core area to include all zones and edges of the park. We found significantly lower relative abundance indices (RAIs) for certain mammal species, and collectively for all mammals compared to data obtained in 1999-2000 from 34 similar survey locations, suggesting population declines linked to increased human activity. Information from long-term camera-trapping can provide critical information on the occurrence of elusive species, hotspots, the role of invasive or domestic species, and an indication of the effectiveness of patrolling and other management and conservation interventions.",

We used a density estimate established by intensive monitoring of a population of radiotagged leopards (Panthera pardus) with a detection probability of 1.0 to evaluate efficacy of track counts and camera-trap surveys as population estimators. We calculated densities from track counts using 2 methods and compared performance of 10 methods for calculating the effectively sampled area for camera-trapping data. Compared to our reference density (7.33 +- 0.44 leopards/100 km2), camera-trapping generally produced more accurate but less precise estimates than did track counts. The most accurate result (6.97 +- 1.88 leopards/100 km2) came from camera-trap data with a sampled area buffered by a boundary strip representing the mean maximum distance moved by leopards outside the survey area (MMDMOSA) established by telemetry. However, contrary to recent suggestions, the traditional method of using half the mean maximum distance moved from photographic recaptures did not result in gross overestimates of population density (6.56 +- 1.92 leopards/100 km2) but rather displayed the next best performance after MMDMOSA. The only track-count method comparable to reference density employed a capture--recapture framework applied to data when individuals were identified from their tracks (6.45 +- 1.43 leopards/100 km2) but the underlying assumptions of this technique limit more widespread application. Our results demonstrate that if applied correctly, camera-trap surveys represent the best balance of rigor and cost-effectiveness for estimating abundance and density of cryptic carnivore species that can be identified individually.",

	abstract = "Camera-trap surveys, when combined with capture--recapture models, are an accurate and cost-effective method for estimating the abundance of individually identifiable carnivore species such as leopards, Panthera pardus. Reliable population estimates for leopards are particularly useful as they enable informed conservation and management decisions for a species that, although widespread, is heavily persecuted. Here we present the results of a camera-trap survey that estimated the population density of leopards in Zululand Rhino Reserve (ZRR) in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We divided our study area in half and subsampled each section for 40 days using 34 paired camera-trap stations. The combined data yielded captures of six individual leopards (3 male, 3 female) photographed on 19 occasions. Using the program CAPTURE, population abundance was estimated according to two models; one that assumes homogeneous capture probabilities among individual leopards (Mo) and one that allows for heterogeneity in capture probabilities between individuals (Mh). For model Mo, the resultant capture probability was 0.317 and estimated abundance was 6 ± 0.390 (6--6, 95\% CI). For model Mh, the resultant capture probability was 0.112 and estimated abundance was 17 ± 6.37 (10--37, 95\% CI). The area effectively sampled by the camera-traps was 234 km2. Therefore, the estimated population density of leopards in the reserve was 2.5 ± 0.195 leopards per 100 km2 according to model Mo, and 7.00 ± 2.64 leopards per 100 km2 according to model Mh. When compared with the results of similar surveys conducted in nearby reserves, our findings suggest that the leopard population in the ZRR is below carrying capacity. To encourage population recovery, we recommend that no trophy hunting of leopards be conducted in the reserve, that measures be introduced to reduce retaliatory killing of leopards by livestock owners in surrounding areas, and that the illegal trade in leopard skins be addressed.

	abstract = "Using remote camera traps for surveying and monitoring trends in abundance and density: a case study of a cheetah population in north-central Namibia. 1. The ability to monitor population abundance and density is necessary in assessing trends, while providing vital information for designing of conservation actions. This is a complex task, especially for species such as the cheetah Acinonyx jubatus due to behavioural and ecological aspects. Consequently, current population estimates are often based on methods that do not account for sampling biases such as imperfect detection. We investigated the use of remote camera trapping (RCT) with classical and spatial capture recapture (SCR) models for monitoring the abundance and density of a cheetah population while exploring the utilisation patterns of scent marking sites in north-central Namibia. 2. We analysed RCT data collected mostly at scent marking sites for 10 surveys conducted between 2005 and 2011, each lasting three months. In addition, four camera-detected male cheetahs were fitted with GSM collars to assess home range overlap in relation to the camera trap polygon. 3. Overall, 54 unique cheetahs were identified (8 ± 4 individuals per survey), which were predominantly nocturnal with some crepuscular behaviour. We observed high fidelity to scent stations for up to 4 years by resident cheetahs, with new recruits displaying spatial and temporal patterns that were similar to their predecessors{\rq}. 4. Density estimates based on effective sampling areas were determined using classical methods such as the full Mean Maximum Distance Moved and the home range radius or sum of home range sizes, which were similar to SCR-based estimates. However, SCR multi-survey density estimates were more consistent and ranged between 5 and 16 km-3??, with a coefficient of variation of 11.7\%. Further, our data provide some evidence suggesting that male density may be regulated by home range dynamics, as it remained similar only in periods of social stability. 5. In addition to reporting robust longitudinal density estimates for cheetahs using RCT with SCR methods, this study provides information on behavioural aspects such as spatial overlap and utilisation of scent marking sites. Overall, we found that the techniques applied here hold great promise for surveying cheetah populations in general, and highlight the need for sampling large areas in order to obtain reliable estimates. Insights of temporal activity patterns of resident individual cheetahs, in north- central Namibia. The activity patterns of cheetahs are largely unknown for populations where it coexists only with part of the large carnivore guilds. This is the case for the Namibian cheetah population residing on farmlands, where dominant predators, lions and spotted hyenas, are absent, but leopards and brown hyenas persist. In this study, we used photographic captures of 10 three months surveys conducted between 2005 and 2011 (five in winter and summer), to describe the temporal activity patterns of cheetahs across seasons at least to scent marking sites. This is the first insight into inter-individual interactions. A strong nocturnal and crepuscular activity pattern was retrieved which was consistent across season essentially for males but females despite a low sample size also showed a crepuscular pattern. At the individual level, activities patterns between a resident single male and a coalition of two male, overlapped but differed in the time of activity peak, with the latter increasing in activity at times when the former declines. This suggests that movements by males and at least in respect towards scent marking sites occurs during nighttime. Ultimately, these findings contribute to the growing evidence of cheetahs being nocturnal across its range.",

	abstract = "The use of indirect indices, such as the detection of tracks (spoor), to estimate animal abundance has been questioned due to the impact of environmental variables such as substrate quality. It is important, therefore to calibrate indices against absolute abundance estimates made using other techniques. It is also important to determine whether indices are responsive to annual changes in population, and to understand the relationship between sampling effort and population estimates. In this study, spoor density for cheetah was evaluated against density estimated using radio telemetry on a commercial farm in Namibia. Least-linear regression and Spearman's correlation were used to evaluate the relationship between density estimates derived by the two methods. Two transects, one situated within medium to thick bush (A) and the other on mostly open vegetation (B), showed no significant relationship with density as estimated through radio-telemetry. Transect A showed a weak positive trend whereas B showed a negative trend. Spoor data pooled across the two transects also showed no significant relationship with estimated density (r =17.8, Y=2.05X+O.35). Only transect A showed a similar pattern to the radio telemetry in terms of annual density changes. This study established that a minimum sampling effort of 1655km is required in order for spoor tracking to minimize variability in spoor frequency. Differences in spoor tracking and radio-telemetry sampling areas sizes, the lack of more localized absolute abundance estimates, the spatial and social organization of cheetah and the fact that transects were originally laid for ungulate strip counts, were factors suggested to have contributed to the poor calibration results obtained in this study. Further research is recommend, in which transects are reconfigured to encompass home ranges of as many individuals as possible, and in which attempts are made to identify individuals responsible for spoor possible through the use of remote-cameras placed along the transects. As of yet, calibration studies have primarily been performed on demarcated conservation areas, where individuals could be individually identified. Not all these calibrations studies reported indices to be a function of true density. Nevertheless , spoor frequency has been reported to be a function of true density for carnivores in certain Parks in Namibia . Precisely , cheetah spoor density was reported to correlate with visuals in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. The majority of these studies elucidate a species spatial organization, animal behaviour, as the paramount factor determining the relationship between densities estimated via different censusing methods. Thus, the efficiency of spoor frequency to estimate and monitor relative abundance for wild cheetahs is yet to be empirically tested . Despite the lack of a true density estimate for the free-ranging cheetahs in the study area, evaluated spoor tracking as a possible index to monitor relative cheetah abundance using radio-telemetry densities estimates as representative of true abundance for the area, for the 1995 to 2000 period. The study is considered to be opportunistic , and a pillar for future research, as transects where spoor tracking was conducted were layout primarily for ungulates strip counts. Least-linear regression and Spearman's correlation were used to evaluate the relationship between density estimates derived by the two methods. Percentages of change on annual densities were also regressed as a mean to test spoor frequency sensitivity to density changes. The calibration of spoor frequency with estimates of density produced using radio-telemetry, without the ascription of imprints to individual animals, was poor (rs=17.4 , y=0.36+0.20). The sensitivity analysis also showed spoor tracking poor reliability to monitor cheetah population. This can be attributed, in order of importance, to the discrepancies on the spatial extent sampled by the two methods, the species large home ranges, substrate quality , habitat preferences, the availability of farm road networks and the transect design, i.e., cyclic. However, the paramount factor limiting the study conclusions was the lack of a more local density estimate at a farm level. Therefore, the use of spoor frequency to estimate wild cheetah relative abundance requires further research, particularly using a different sampling design, longer straight transects and the acquisition of local densities estimates (and camera traps - see above).",

We advise that studies of jaguars and pumas from biodiverse regions such as tropical rainforests should aim to collect samples of at least 70--100 scats to adequately describe diet. Samples half this size will probably detect the principal prey species but cannot yield reliable estimates of relative occurrence. The interpretation of findings from studies with low sample sizes would be helped by presenting dietary components with an accompanying list or count of potential prey species occurring in the local area and/or a species accumulation curve. Although felid scats are generally difficult to find, particularly in hot humid climates where faecal material rapidly decomposes or washes away, often scat collection is opportunistic and given low priority in felid studies.

In the initial stage of this project, five felids were captured: one adult male jaguar (Panthera onca), one adult female jaguar, one adult female puma (Puma concolor) and two female ocelots (Leopardus parda/is). Chasing with dogs was not used as a capture method due to high ambient temperatures (38-42° C) before midday), because the chase, in combination with the anaesthetic would increase the risk of an elevated body temperature in the tranquilized felid. Instead we used rubber-padded leg-hold traps (The Livestock Protection Co., Alpine Texas). This method had the additional advantages that it allowed having all the veterinary gear near the tranquilized felid, and avoided the danger involved for the felids, dogs and researchers. For the immobilization we used a combination ofthe central alphaz adrenoceptor agonist, Medetomidine, in combination with the dissociative anaesthetic, Ketamine hydrochloride, delivered with a Telinject air-compressed blowpipe. This drug combination was chosen because ofthe excellent reports in the literature (zoos andlor captive conditions) which indicated better anaesthesia of carnivores than the commonly used Xylazine-Ketamine combination. AIso Medetomidine has the additional advantage of the possible use of a reversing agent (Atipamezole, an alphaz adrenoceptor antagonist) that can be injected immediately after procedures (Jalanka, 1989a, 1989b; Barnett \& Lewis, 1990; Jalanka \& Roeken. 1990; Swan, 1993).

Determining reliable measures of abundance is, however, dif��ficult, especially with wide-ranging species such as cheetah Acinonyx jubatus. This study generated a correction factor to calculate true cheetah density from spoor survey data and subsequently tested its accuracy using the following season{\rq}s data. Data were collected from October 2005 to December 2006 on a known population of wild, free-ranging cheetah in the Jwana Game Reserve, Botswana. The cheetahs in the area were captured, tagged and photographed. The reserve was divided into twelve 9 km transects covering all vegetation types and prey densities. The total sampling distance was 8226 km, with a spoor density of 2.32 individual cheetah spoor per 100 km2. To determine a precise and accurate spoor density, it was necessary to sample for a longer period during the dry season (April--September) than during the wet season (October--March). This difference may be due to cheetah behavioural changes with seasonal variations in habitat and prey. The true density was 5.23 cheetahs per 100 km2 ranging from 3.33 to 7.78 at the low and high points of the population, respectively. A positive linear correlation between spoor and true density was observed. This relationship differed in the wet and dry season and required re��finement with the following season{\rq}s data. Correction factors may be viable, but require further testing taking the behavioural responses to seasonal, habitat and prey variations into consideration.",

	abstract = "The goal of ecology is to understand interactions that determine the distribution and abundance of organisms. In principle, ecologists should be able to identify a small number of limiting resources for a species of interest, estimate densities of these resources at different locations across the landscape, and then use these estimates to predict the density of the focal species at these locations. In practice, however, development of functional relationships between abundances of species and their resources has proven extremely dif��ficult, and examples of such predictive ability are very rare. Ecological studies of prey requirements of tigers Panthera tigris led us to develop a simple mechanistic model for predicting tiger density as a function of prey density. We tested our model using data from a landscape-scale long-term (1995--2003) ��field study that estimated tiger and prey densities in 11 ecologically diverse sites across India. We used ��field techniques and analytical methods that speci��fically addressed sampling and detectability, two issues that frequently present problems in macroecological studies of animal populations. Estimated densities of ungulate prey ranged between 5.3 and 63.8 animals per km2. Estimated tiger densities (3.2--16.8 tigers per 100 km2) were reasonably consistent with model predictions. The results provide evidence of a functional relationship between abundances of large carnivores and their prey under a wide range of ecological conditions. In addition to generating important insights into carnivore ecology and conservation, the study provides a potentially useful model for the rigorous conduct of macroecological science.",

@book{Liebenberg_1990,
	abstract = {According to a popular misconception, nature is "like an open book" to the expert tracker and such an expert needs only enough skill to "read everything that is written in the sand". A more appropriate analogy would be that the expert tracker must be able to "read between the lines". Trackers themselves cannot read everything in the sand. Rather, they must be able to read into the sand. To interpret tracks and signs trackers must project themselves into the position of the animal in order to create a hypothetical explanation of what the animal was doing. Tracking is not strictly empirical, since it also involves the tracker's imagination. Generally speaking, ore may argue that science is not only a product of objective observation of the world through sense perception. It is also a product of the human imagination. A creative hypothesis is not found or discovered in the outside world, it comes from within the human mind. If the an of tracking is indeed the origin of science, then gaining a better understanding of tracking may help to explain the phenomenal success of science. From an evolutionary point of view, the origin of the creative scientific imagination due to natural selection by nature may explain why it is so successful in nature. If it is assumed that the modern scientific brain has been adapted in part to the necessity of tracking down animals, what limitations, if any, does such a brain place on the modern scientist's understanding of nature? If modern physicists are thinking with a tracker's brain, how does this influence the theories they create in order to explain the fundamentals of nature? This book will not seek to provide full answers to such questions but rather confine itself to a description of tracking itself and its relation to modern science.},

	abstract = "In order to accurately assess the status of the cheetah Acinonyx jubatus it is necessary to obtain data on numbers and demographic trends. However, cheetahs are notoriously difficult to survey because they occur at very low population densities and are often shy and elusive. In South Africa the problem is further complicated in areas where land is privately owned, restricting access, with dense bush and cheetahs that are frequently persecuted. Cheetahs are individually identifiable by their unique spot patterns, making them ideal candidates for capture--recapture surveys. Photographs of cheetahs were obtained using four camera traps placed successively at a total of 12 trap locations in areas of known cheetah activity within a 300 km² area in the Thabazimbi district of the Limpopo Province. During 10 trapping periods, five different cheetahs were photographed. These results were used to generate capture histories for each cheetah and the data were analysed using the capture--recapture software package CAPTURE. Closure tests indicated that the population was closed (P = 0.056). The Mh model was used to deal with possible heterogeneous capture probabilities among individual cheetahs. Closure tests did not reject the model assumption of population closure (P = 0.056). The Mh model produced a capture probability of 0.17 with an estimate of 6--14 cheetahs (P = 0.95) and a mean population size of seven cheetahs (S.E. = 1.93). These results are promising and will be improved with employment of more camera traps and sampling a larger area.",

@article{Marx_2013,
	abstract = "Biologists are joining the big-data club. With the advent of high-throughput genomics, life scientists are starting to grapple with massive data sets, encountering challenges with handling, processing and moving information that were once the domain of astronomers and high-energy physicists. Biology data mining has challenges all of its own, says Birney. Biological data are much more heterogeneous than those in physics. They stem from a wide range of experiments that spit out many types of information, such as genetic sequences, interactions of proteins or findings in medical records. The complexity is daunting, says Lawrence Hunter, a computational biologist at the University of Colorado Denver. ``Getting the most from the data requires interpreting them in light of all the relevant prior knowledge,'' he says. That means scientists have to store large data sets, and analyse, compare and share them --- not simple tasks. Even a single sequenced human genome is around 140 gigabytes in size. Comparing human genomes takes more than a personal computer and online file-sapplications such as DropBox. Andreas Sundquist says amounts of data are now larger than the tools used to analyse them. Clouds are a solution, but they also throw up fresh challenges. Ironically, their proliferation can cause a bottleneck if data end up parked on several clouds and thus still need to be moved to be shared. And using clouds means entrusting valuable data to a distant service provider who may be subject to power outages or other disruptions. ``I use cloud services for many things, but always keep a local copy of scientifically important data and software,'' says Hunter. Scientists experiment with different constellations to suit their needs and trust levels. The cost of producing, acquiring and disseminating data is decreasing, says James Taylor, a computational biologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, who thinks that ``everyone should have access to the skills and tools'' needed to make sense of all the information. Taylor is a co-founder of an academic platform called Galaxy, which lets scientists analyse their data and share software tools and workflows for free. Through Web-based access to computing facilities at Pennsylvania State University (PSU) in University Park, scientists can download Galaxy{\rq}s platform of tools to their local hardware, or use it on the Galaxy cloud. They can then plug in their own data, perform analyses and save the steps in them, or try out workflows set up by their colleagues. Spearheaded by Taylor and Anton Nekrutenko, a molecular biologist at PSU, the Galaxy project draws on a community of around 100 software developers. One feature is Tool Shed, a virtual area with more than 2,700 software tools that users can upload, try out and rate. Xu says that he likes the collection and its ratings, because without them, scientists must always check if a software tool actually runs before they can use it. Galaxy is a good fit for scientists with some computing know-how, says Alla Lapidus, a computational biologist in the algorithmic biology lab at St Petersburg Academic University of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which is led by Pavel Pevzner, a computer scientist at UCSD. But, she says, the platform might not be the best choice for less tech-savvy researchers. When Lapidus wanted to disseminate the software tools that she developed, she chose to put them on DNAnexus{\rq}s newly launched second-generation commercial cloud-based analysis platform. Given that big-data analysis in biology is incredibly difficult, Hunter says, open science is becoming increasingly important. As he explains, researchers need to make their data available to the scientific community in a useful form, for others to mine. New science can emerge from the analysis of existing data sets: McClure generates some of her findings from other people{\rq}s data. But not everyone recognizes that kind of biology as an equal. ``The cultural baggage of biology that privileges data generation over all other forms of science is holding us back,'' says Hunter. A number of McClure{\rq}s graduate students are microbial ecologists, and she teaches them how to rethink their findings in the face of so many new data. ``Before taking my class, none of these students would have imagined that they could produce new, meaningful knowledge, and new hypotheses, from existing data, not their own,'' she says. Big data in biology add to the possibilities for scientists, she says, because data sit ``under-analysed in databases all over the world''.",

Our study is the ��first to demonstrate that the relative abundance of tigers and their prey, as measured by camera traps, is directly related to independently derived estimates of densities for these species. The tiger population in the park is estimated at 40--43 individuals. Results indicate that illegal hunting of prey and tigers, measured as a function of human density within 10 km of the park, is primarily responsible for observed patterns of abundance, and that habitat loss is an increasingly serious problem. Abundance of tigers, two mouse deer (Tragulus spp.), pigs (Sus scrofa) and Sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) was more than four times higher in areas with low human population density, while densities of red muntjac (Muntiacus muntjac) and pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina) were twice as high. Malay tapir (Tapirus indicus) and argus pheasant (Argusianus argus), species infrequently hunted, had higher indices of relative abundance in areas with high human density. Edge effects associated with park boundaries were not a signi��ficant factor in abundance of tigers or prey once human density was considered.

In parallel, a wealth of camera trap systems and models has become commercially available, a phenomenon mainly driven by the increased use of camera traps by sport hunters. This has raised the need for developing criteria to choose the suitable camera trap model in relation to a range of factors, primarily the study aim, but also target species, habitat, trapping site, climate and any other aspect that affects camera performance. There is also fragmented information on the fundamentals of sampling designs that deploy camera trapping, such as number of sampling sites, spatial arrangement and sampling duration. In this review, we describe the relevant technological features of camera traps and propose a set of the key ones to be evaluated when choosing camera models. These features are camera speci��fications such as trigger speed, sensor sensitivity, detection zone, ��flash type and ��flash intensity, power autonomy, and related speci��fications. We then outline sampling design and camera features for the implementation of major camera trapping applications, speci��fically: (1) faunal inventories, (2) occupancy studies, (3) density estimation through Capture-Mark-Recapture and (4) density estimation through the Random Encounter Model. We also review a range of cur- rently available models and stress the need for standardized testing of camera models that should be frequently updated and widely distributed. Finally we summarize the ``ultimate camera trap'', as desired by wildlife biologists, and the current technological limitations of camera traps in relation to their potential for a number of emerging applications.

These 23 pugmark-sets were then divided into two groups, one of 15 pugmark-sets for model building and another of eight pugmark-sets for model testing and validation. A total of 93 measurements were taken from each pugmark along with three gait measurements. We used CV ratio, F-ratio and removed highly correlated variables to ��finally select 11 variables from these 93 variables. These 11 variables did not differ between left and right pugmarks. Stepwise discriminant function analysis (DFA) based on these 11 variables correctly classi��fied pugmark-sets to individual tigers. A realistic population estimation exercise was simulated using the validation dataset. The algorithms developed here correctly allocated each pugmark-set to the correct individual tiger. The effect of extraneous factors, i.e. soil depth and multiple tracers, was also tested and pugmark tracings compared with pugmark photographs.

Indirect sampling, by counting spoor, could provide repeatable and inexpensive measures of some population parameters. The relationship between true population density and indirect sampling results has seldom been described in large carnivore studies. 3. In northern Namibia the population densities of leopards, lions and wild dogs were measured through recognition of individuals and groups. Spoor counts were then conducted independently, to assess the relationship between true density and the distribution of spoor. 4. Sampling effort, both in terms of the number of roads and total road distance in a sample zone, and the intensity of sampling, had a marked effect on the accuracy and precision of spoor frequency calculations. 5. In a homogeneous habitat leopard spoor were evenly spread along different roads and spoor frequency was independent of road length. Taking into account very low sample sizes, the spoor density of leopards, lions and wild dogs showed a strong correlation with true density.

In the absence of larger carnivores, which have been credited with providing larger food items for brown hyaenas elsewhere, we compared interspecific dietary overlap and activity patterns with the remaining large carnivores, leopards and cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Where hyaenas and leopards were sympatric, diets of both nocturnal species (n = 212 hyaena scats and 41 leopard scats) were quite similar (both >89\% wild, with some domestic ungulates), and only somewhat different from cheetahs in a previous study.

Specifically, the purpose of the study was: 1) To ascertain whether African felids are attracted to novel scents. While captive cats are drawn to a wide variety of fragrances, we wanted to assess the response of free-ranging felids to novel scents where they might i) explore scents because they are unfamiliar and interesting, or ii) avoid scents because they might be associated with human activity. 2) Assess whether these scents would elicit rubbing responses that could be used to facilitate the collection of hair samples from African felids.

Sign surveys out-performed the other methods in all comparison criteria, although supplementary methods were needed for some species and sites. We found that using established analysis techniques, robust landscape-scale abundance estimates would require unrealistically high effort and cost.

This limits knowledge of large-scale patterns in distribution, abundance and their underlying determinants, hindering conservation of globally threatened carnivore populations. Occupancy analysis of data from logistically ef��ficient sign surveys along consecutive road segments (spatially auto-correlated replicates) offers a potential solution. We adapted and applied this newly-developed method over 62,979 km2 of human-modi��fied land in South Africa. Our aims were to (1) generate unbiased estimates of brown hyaena occupancy and abundance (2) investigate two suspected determinants of occupancy using a combination of biological and socio-economic sampling techniques, and (3) use simulations to evaluate the effort required for abundance and occupancy estimates with acceptable bias, precision and power. Brown hyaena occupancy was estimated at 0.748 (±SE 0.1), and estimated overall density in agricultural land (0.15/100 km2, ±SE 0.08) was an order of magnitude lower than in protected areas. Positive attitudes to carnivores and presence of wildlife farms exerted strong positive effects on occupancy, so changes in these factors may well exert monotonic impacts on local metapopulation status. Producing reliable occupancy and abundance estimates would require P6 replicates and P12 replicates per site respectively. Detecting 50\% and 30\% declines in brown hyaena occupancy with adequate power would require ��five annual surveys at P65 sites and P125 sites respectively. Our results suggest that protocols based on spatially auto-correlated sign survey replicates could be used to monitor carnivore populations at large, and possibly even country-wide spatial scales.",

This concept is equally applicable to interspecific competition and in a heterogeneous environment species with low competitive ability should seek out competition refuges where competition is reduced. 1. Cheetahs have low competitive ability compared with their principal competitors hyenas and lions which are directly responsible for their low density. This study uses distribution data collected in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania over a 3 year period to show that cheetahs are more strongly associated with each other than with their competitors and utilize areas with low density prey. 2. Cheetahs exhibit local avoidance behaviour in both space and time with respect to lions and hyenas. This behaviour is facultative and is strongest when cheetahs are engaged in activities that might expose them to food loss or increase the risk of close interactions, such as when they are hunting or eating. 3. Lactating cheetahs whose range is restricted are more likely to have difficulties finding prey and come into more frequent contact with lions than free-ranging animals. 4. It is argued that although cheetahs always lose in direct competition they persist in the ecosystem by seeking out competition refuges with low densities of lions and hyenas and that their mobility is the key to their continued coexistence with these predators. This pattern of distribution may be generally applicable to other species which, although widely distributed, always occur at low densities.",

These hypotheses were tested on cheetahs which incur substantial juvenile mortality from predation by two larger competitors: spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, and lions, Panthera leo. To examine avoidance tactics, I played lion and hyaena vocalizations to individual female cheetahs. Lion avoidance increased with the statistical interaction between age and reproductive success, suggesting that it may be a learned behaviour, reinforced by successful reproductive events. This behaviour translated into a nonrandom spatial distribution of cheetahs with the most reproductively successful females found near lower lion densities than less successful females. Hyaena avoidance decreased with the interaction between age and reproductive success, suggesting that it is diminished by successful reproductive events, perhaps because a female cheetah switches from avoidance to using antipredator behaviours as she gets older.

	abstract = "Occupancy modeling focuses on inference about the distribution of organisms over space, using temporal or spatial replication to allow inference about the detection process. Inference based on spatial replication strictly requires that replicates be selected randomly and with replacement, but the importance of these design requirements is not well understood. This paper focuses on an increasingly popular sampling design based on spatial replicates that are not selected randomly and that are expected to exhibit Markovian dependence. We develop two new occupancy models for data collected under this sort of design, one based on an underlying Markov model for spatial dependence and the other based on a trap response model with Markovian detections. We then simulated data under the model for Markovian spatial dependence and ��fit the data to standard occupancy models and to the two new models. Bias of occupancy estimates was substantial for the standard models, smaller for the new trap response model, and negligible for the new spatial process model. We also ��fit these models to data from a large-scale tiger occupancy survey recently conducted in Karnataka State, southwestern India. In addition to providing evidence of a positive relationship between tiger occupancy and habitat, model selection statistics and estimates strongly supported the use of the model with Markovian spatial dependence. This new model provides another tool for the decomposition of the detection process, which is sometimes needed for proper estimation and which may also permit interesting biological inferences. In addition to designs employing spatial replication, we note the likely existence of temporal Markovian dependence in many designs using temporal replication. The models developed here will be useful either directly, or with minor extensions, for these designs as well. We believe that these new models represent important additions to the suite of modeling tools now available for occupancy estimation in conservation monitoring. More generally, this work represents a contribution to the topic of cluster sampling for situations in which there is a need for speci��fic modeling (e.g., re��flecting dependence) for the distribution of the variable(s) of interest among subunits.",

Seven major dietary categories were identified from the scats, with mammal remains being most common for both species. Brown hyaena scats contained more large mammal remains, which together with the presence of invertebrates (in 50\% of all brown hyaena scats), suggests that they mainly scavenged. Jackal scats contained a higher proportion of small mammal remains, suggesting that jackals actively hunted more often than brown hyaenas did. The diets differed significantly between the two species, even though diet overlap was fairly high (0.79). Further analysis, albeit based on small sample sizes, suggests that diet of these mesopredators differ between protected reserves with apex predators and unprotected areas without apex predators, thus confounding generalizations.

	abstract = {Global warming and land reform are amongst the issues that have pushed rangeland degradation in Namibia to the fore once again. lt should be realized that the application of realistic grazing capacities (GC) holds the key to sustainable rangeland utilization. A realistic grazing capacity map could play a major role in aiding policy makers towards informed decisions regarding land reform issues. However,it is just about impossible to accurately establish the GC of an area, based on the large number of variables influencing it. This does not mean, however, that one should stop attempts to do so. Currently, three methods of determining GC are being applied or investigated by researchers in the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry. These are: the quantitative yield method (measuring grass and animal biomass, and matching animal requirement to the amount of plant biomass available), remote sensing, and generating grazing index values for plants based on their biomass production, nutritive value and palatability. Although the quantitative yield method, or clipping quadrats, remains one of the most accurate methodologies to determine grazing capacity in Namibia's heterogeneous rangelands, calculated GC values are still subject to a statistical error of 20\%. Compiling photo guides based on the clipping of quadrats could be a valuable tool to assist farmers in the sustainable use of their rangelands. Remote sensing is best suited to areas with a homogeneous vegetation. Although real time data can be acquired through remote sensing, images still need to be validated through the time consuming process of ground truthing. The heterogeneous nature of Namibia's rangelands does not lend itself readily to this advanced technology. technology. The Grazing Index Value project will be launched at the beginning 2006. Due to the agronomic traits to be included in the establishment of a grazing index value, it is believed that more accurate grazing capacities for the south of Namibia,with its strong dwarf shrub component, can be established. In order to establish accurate grazing capacities over the long term, whichever methodology proves to be the most appropriate in terms of accuracy, time, manpower and finances, will have to be repeated over a number of years to capture all variation inherent in GC determination. In order to overcome the time constraint here, it might be meaningful to adapt the current grazing capacity map in terms of structural problems that exist (e.g. bush encroachment), "officialise" the map and use it in future land reform policy decisions.},

To date, evidence in support of the non-equilibrium concept has been inconsistent. Using a standardized protocol, including a newly developed global map of rainfall variability, we reviewed the incidence of degradation in relation to rainfall variability across 58 published studies. We distinguished between (1) zonal degradation (i.e., degradation independent of water and key resources), (2) degradation in the presence of key resources, and (3) degradation in the presence of water. For studies not affected by proximity to permanent water or key resources, we found strong support for the non-equilibrium concept for rangelands. Zonal degradation was absent at CV (coef��ficient of variation) values above 33\%, which has been proposed as a critical threshold. Grazing degradation was almost entirely restricted to areas with relatively stable annual precipitation as expressed by a low CV, or to rangelands with key resources or water points nearby. To better understand rangeland dynamics, we recommend that future studies use globally comparable measures of degradation and rainfall variability. Our work underlines that rangelands with relatively stable rainfall patterns, and those with access to water or key resources, are potentially vulnerable to degradation. Grazing management in such areas should incorporate strategic rest periods. Such rest periods effectively mimic natural ��fluctuations in herbivore populations, which are a de��fining characteristic of non-degraded rangelands occurring under highly variable precipitation regimes.

I think that a convincing case can be made that this paradigm is absolutely false. Economics and ecology, especially when considered in the long run, are inherently linked and should be looked at like a win-win game not a zero-sum game. In other words, if a rancher or farmer wants a good long-term economic situation, they will have to have, at the very least, a sustainable ecological base. More than likely we need an improving ecological base. Do natural resource managers (my word for ranchers) really have the knowledge to make a profit while improving their resources or environment? Would anyone outside the ranching business believe us if we could?

	abstract = "The in��fluence of both local and global drivers on long-term changes in the vegetation of Namibia's extensive rangelands was investigated. Fifty-two historical photographs of the Palgrave Expedition of 1876 were re-photographed and used to document changes over more than 130 years, in grass, shrub and tree cover within three major biomes along a 1200 km climatic gradient in central and southern Namibia. We showed that patterns of change are correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) and that below a threshold of around 250 mm, vegetation has remained remarkably stable regardless of land-use or tenure regime. Above this threshold, an increase in tree cover is linked to the rainfall gradient, the legacies of historical events in the late 19th century, subsequent transformations in land-use and increased atmospheric CO2. We discuss these ��findings in relation to pastoral and settler societies, paleo- and historical climatic trends and predictions of vegetation change under future global warming scenarios. We argue that changes in land-use associated with colonialism (decimation of megaherbivores and wildlife browsers; ��fire suppression, cattle ranching), as well as the effects of CO2 fertilisation provide the most parsimonious explanations for vegetation change. We found no evidence that aridi��fication, as projected under future climate change scenarios, has started in the region. This study provided empirical evidence and theoretical insights into the relative importance of local and global drivers of change in the savanna environments of central and southern Namibia and global savanna ecosystems more generally.",

	abstract = "In the Otjiwarongo region (Northern Namibia), Vertisol -- Kastanozem -- Calcisol soil associations occur as patches of several hundred hectares in extent. They have formed in fine-grained Mid-Holocene sediments which accumulated on both sides of the subcontinental watershed between the Ugab River draining into the South Atlantic and the Omatako Omuramba draining into the Kalahari Basin. Kastanozem formation cannot be explained by the environments that exist at present. The humification suggests open savanna environments in the past and does not accord with the shrublands and thornbush savanna at present. Using AMS 14C and OSL data, it is possible to distinguish two periods of soil degradation during the recent past. Initially, most of the Kastanozems and Vertisols were buried by slope wash sediments to a depth of several decimetres. This process started in the mid-19th century at the latest. In a second phase, the soils were affected by rill and gully erosion, indicating increased runoff. This occurred during the last decades of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, probably as a result of intensified cattle farming. In contrast to other parts of Namibia, the prominent river channels of the Otjiwarongo region, most of them up to 20 m wide and 3 -- 4 m deep, are a result of recent erosion. Degradation of vegetation and soils, and river channel formation, seem to be the main causes of farmland aridification. Keywords: Kastanozems; Namibia; Soil erosion; Environmental change; Holocene",

Few comprehensive assessments of such land uses on private land in southern Africa have been conducted and the associated bene��fits are not always acknowledged by politicians. Nonetheless, wildlife-based land uses are growing in prevalence on private land. In Namibia wildlife-based land use occurs over c. 287,000 km2. Employment is positively related to income from ecotourism and negatively related to income from livestock. While 87\% of meat from livestock is exported $ 95% of venison from wildlife-based land uses remains within the country, contributing to food security. Wildlife populations are increasing with expansion of wildlife-based land uses, and private farms contain 21--33 times more wildlife than in protected areas. Because of the popularity of wildlife-based land uses among younger farmers, increasing tourist arrivals and projected impacts of climate change on livestock production, the economic output of wildlife-based land uses will probably soon exceed that of livestock. However, existing policies favour livestock production and are prejudiced against wildlife-based land uses by prohibiting reintroductions of bu�ffalo Syncerus ca�ffer, a key species for tourism and safari hunting, and through subsidies that arti��ficially in��flate the pro��fitability of livestock production. Returns from wildlife-based land uses are also limited by the failure to reintroduce other charismatic species, failure to develop fully-integrated conservancies and to integrate black farmers suﬃciently. $",

	abstract = "Conservation of free-ranging cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) populations is multi faceted and needs to be addressed from an ecological, biological and management perspective. There is a wealth of published research, each focusing on a particular aspect of cheetah conservation. Identifying the most important factors, making sense of various (and sometimes contrasting) findings, and taking decisions when little or no empirical data is available, are everyday challenges facing conservationists. Bayesian networks (BN) provide a statistical modeling framework that enables analysis and integration of information addressing different aspects of conservation. There has been an increased interest in the use of BNs to model conservation issues, however the development of more sophisticated BNs, utilizing object-oriented (OO) features, is still at the frontier of ecological research. We describe an integrated, parallel modeling process followed during a BN modeling workshop held in Namibia to combine expert knowledge and data about free-ranging cheetahs. The aim of the workshop was to obtain a more comprehensive view of the current viability of the free-ranging cheetah population in Namibia, and to predict the effect different scenarios may have on the future viability of this free-ranging cheetah population. Furthermore, a complementary aim was to identify influential parameters of the model to more effectively target those parameters having the greatest impact on population viability. The BN was developed by aggregating diverse perspectives from local and independent scientists, agents from the national ministry, conservation agency members and local fieldworkers. This integrated BN approach facilitates OO modeling in a multi-expert context which lends itself to a series of integrated, yet independent, subnetworks describing different scientific and management components. We created three subnetworks in parallel: a biological, ecological and human factors network, which were then combined to create a complete representation of free-ranging cheetah population viability. Such OOBNs have widespread relevance to the effective and targeted conservation management of vulnerable and endangered species.

	abstract = "The ecological processes of the three dominant savannas found in central Namibia, namely the Highland, Thornbush, and Camelthorn savannas, are explained with a state-and-transition model that incorporates aspects of Clementsian succession as well as Walter's two-layer theories. A savanna can persist either in a grassy or in a woody (bushy, bush-encroached) state. Within each, climax and pioneer states with higher and lesser production potential exist. The flrst part of this article describes the grassy states. Transitional forces and events that shift savannas between and within states are described in detail, as well as the opportunities and risks these changes bear for the land manager. A transition that should be avoided at all cost is that from pioneer grassy state to desertiflcation, because desertiflcation is believed to be irreversible in practice. A critical state occurs when the grassy is changed to a bushy state, but this is discussed in greater detail in Part 2 of this article. Accordingly, a lot of research has yet to be done as our current knowledge of savanna ecological dynamics is far from complete (Ward, 2005). It is believed that these ecological processes are very similar in the three dominant savanna types found in central Namibia, i.e. the Highland, Thronbush and Camelthorn savannas (Giess, 1971). When Westoby, Walker and Noy-Meir (1989) devised the state-and-transition model to better explain ecological dynamics in an environment in constant disequilibrium, it caused a paradigm shift in the perception ol how semi-arid southern African savannas work and function (e.g. Milton \& Hoffman, 1994; Rothauge, 2000; Smit, 2003). The state-and-transition theory includes elements of Clements' (1928) dated classical vegetation succession theory and Walter's (1971) two-layer model of competition between herbaceous and woody components of savanna vegetation. The proposed ecological model of central Namibia's savannas is based mainly on these theories and models, applying in principle to the Highland savanna, the Thornbush savanna to its north and the Camelthorn savanna to its east. This series of papers investigates the ecological processes of central Namibia's savannas (Joubert, Rothauge \& Smit, 2008), flrstly the ecology of grassy states and then that of woody states, so that the major problem of landscape-level bush encroachment can be better understood and dealt with.",

	abstract = {Bush encroachment by Acacia mellifera is initiated by a wet spell of sufficient duration (three years) to allow this woody species to set viable seeds, followed by successful establishment of the seedlings. It is a rare, sporadic event in Namibia and in the arid zones of southern Africa. Bush encroachment follows a "sleep, then leap" mode of action rather than a steady and continuous "creep" mode. Bush seedling establishment is facilitated hugely by the exclusion of fierce veld fires, a grass sward weakened by grazing and by reduced browsing pressure. Hence, the most obvious manner to prevent bush encroachment from occurring in the flrst place is to set a fierce flre whenever rainfall was above the average for three years in a row, but only in those areas that are threatened by bush encroachment. Since the seed of Acacia mellifera is not long-lived, not mobile and not distributed in the dung of herbivores, there is little need to burn areas that do not contain a large proportion of mature Acacia mellifera bushes. If this sporadic opportunity to prevent bush encroachment was missed and the savanna changes from a grassy to a bushy state, fire is no longer an effective means of control. Chemical and mechanical control mechanisms are the best option to thin (rather than eradicate) the population of invasive Acacia mellifera, failing which they will mature over many decades to old age. Only when senescent do they again become vulnerable to stressors and natural control. Control presents an ideal opportunity to improve the grass sward and thus recover the production potential of Namibia's savanna rangelands, but has to be followed by aftercare.},

	abstract = "It is desirable to know the underlying theory behind Holistic Management to understand both the science applied and the methodology. Jan Christian Smuts who wrote ``Holism and Evolution'' in 1926 provided the theoretical base. Smuts, more than anyone subsequently provided sound reasoning to accept ``holism'' as the operating principle in nature. The concept that nature functioned in wholes and patterns of great complexity, unlike the mechanistic world view in which nature is viewed as a complicated machine with interconnecting parts. Using this theoretical base we recognized that land alone is not manageable because it is so tied to the culture, beliefs and values of the people occupying it. Ultimately the practical management of whole situations, in which land is involved, could only be done by viewing people, their land and their economy as one indivisible whole. Land alone is no more manageable than is either hydrogen or oxygen alone manageable in water. The people{\rq}s economy is indivisible from land because the only wealth that can truly sustain any community, or nation, is ultimately derived from the photosynthetic process (plants growing on sustained healthy soils). Holistic Management involves using a simple decision-making framework that ensures all their significant management decisions are simultaneously economically, socially and environmentally sound both short and long term. No longer are decisions made toward objectives or goals alone, but always toward a new concept called the holistic context for any management situation. The holistic context provides the context for all objectives, goals or actions toward any vision or mission. This helps greatly in avoiding unintended consequences to our actions that are so universal that economists long ago used the term ``Law of unintended consequences.''",

There is a history of frustra- tion, problems, waste of resources, unsustainable projects, populations that refuse to participate in programs that violate their true desires, and occasionally conflict that has led to bloodshed. The proof of this is clearly written in the soil, particularly where new technologies, new methods, and new social and economic forces have come into play. With astonishing regularity, projects intended to restore the productivity of soil have instead led to failure, often catastrophic failure worsened by secondary effects that were not foreseen. Examples in Africa are well known. Recently in Tunisia, millions of dollars were spent to plant bushes (Atriplex spp.) on millions of hectares to replace native forage plants that had disappeared. How many of these bushes remain alive now? To benefit nomadic herders in Sudan, Kenya, Mali and Senegal, money was poured into organizing ``livestock units'' modeled on the ranches of Texas. How many remain operational or profitable today? All across the semi-arid zones of Africa livestock wells and water points have been developed. After several decades, what is their condition now? What has happened to the land around them? And is there any place where natural water points - rivers, springs, lakes - remain as abundant as they were a hundred years ago? To raise agricultural production, the world{\rq}s best experts, financed by the world{\rq}s most powerful institutions, have overseen the industrialization of farming through the construction of dams and irrigations systems, miracle crops, and imported fertilizer. However, everywhere in Africa food production is falling. Many countries that fought hard to win political independence, now depend on foreign powers for food. In many African countries and elsewhere, livestock has been banned from millions of hectares ``to allow it to recover.'' But where has it actually recovered enough to offset the loss to the people? Thousands of the best races of sheep, cattle, and goats have been imported from Europe and America so that Africans might ``increase production while reducing their herds'' in order to restore the soil. But where has production really increased? How many of these imported animals have even survived? The answers to these questions are almost all negative, and a good many people now look at development projects as an excuse for cash assistance that has little connexion to development.",

Grasslands cover a very large portion of the earth{\rq}s surface and are important as a feed source for livestock, as a habitat for wildlife, for environmental protection and for the in situ conservation of plant genetic resources.

	abstract = "We examined predation habits of cougars (Puma concolor (L., 1771)) following the recent recovery of gray wolves (Canis lupus L., 1758) in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. With the extirpation of wolves in the early 20th century, cougars likely expanded their niche space to include space vacated by wolves, and increased use of habitat better suited to the foraging of a coursing predator, like wolves. We predicted that as wolves recolonized their former range, competitive exclusion would compel cougars to cede portions of niche space occupied in the absence of wolves. To examine this hypothesis, we radio-tracked cougars and examined their predation sites from winter 2000--2001 through summer 2009. Variation in foraging by cougars was associated with increasing wolf presence. As wolf numbers increased and the mean distance between wolf pack activity centers and cougar predation sites decreased, cougars made kills at higher elevations on more north-facing slopes during summer and in more rugged areas during winter. In addition, cougars preyed on a higher proportion of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus (Ra��finesque, 1817)), consistent with predictions of exploitative competition with wolves. Observed changes in predation characteristics re��flect differences in predation strategy between cougars and wolves, given that wolves are coursing predators and cougars are ambush predators. These possible predation effects should be considered when developing management strategies in systems where the recolonization of wolves may occur.",

	abstract = "Africa is home to the last intact guild of large carnivores and thus provides the only opportunity to investigate mechanisms of coexistence among large predator species. Strong asymmetric dominance hierarchies typically characterize guilds of large carnivores; but despite this asymmetry, subdominant species may persist alongside their stronger counterparts through temporal partitioning of habitat and resources. In the African guild, the subdominant African wild dogs and cheetahs are routinely described as diurnal and crepuscular. These activity patterns have been interpreted to result from the need to avoid encounters with the stronger, nocturnal spotted hyenas and lions. However, the idea that diel activity patterns of carnivore species are strongly shaped by competition and predation has recently been challenged by new observations. In a three-year study in the Okavango Delta, we investigated daily activity patterns and temporal partitioning for wild dogs, cheetahs, spotted hyenas and lions by ��fitting radio collars that continuously recorded activity bursts, to a total of 25 individuals. Analysis of activity patterns throughout the 24-h cycle revealed an unexpectedly high degree of temporal overlap among the four species. This was mainly due to the extensive and previously undescribed nocturnal activity of wild dogs and cheetahs. Their nocturnal activity ��fluctuated with the lunar cycle, represented up to 40\% of the diel activity budget and was primarily constrained by moonlight availability. In contrast, the nocturnal activity patterns of lions and hyenas were unaffected by moonlight and remained constant over the lunar cycle. Our results suggest that other ecological factors such as optimal hunting conditions have shaped the diel activity patterns of subdominant, large predators. We suggest that they are {\lq}{\lq}starvation driven{\rq}{\rq} and must exploit every opportunity to obtain a meal. The bene��fits of activity on moonlit nights therefore offset the risks of encountering night-active predators and competitors.",

Wild dogs and cheetahs exhibited the greatest dietary overlap and smallest dietary niche breadth, while lions exhibited the least dietary overlap and, with leopards, had the broadest dietary niche breadth. Increased extinction risk within the guild was related to lower dietary niche breadth. The behavioural and morphological specializations of the two most threatened predators (wild dogs and cheetahs) limit the prey available to them, and increases the potential for dietary competition. Conversely, the large body mass and group hunting strategy of lions and the predatory flexibility of leopards and spotted hyaenas minimizes the effects of dietary overlap, assuring a more secure status.

Six hypotheses were made based on three hypotheses of factors driving the evolution of predator activity patterns: increased foraging success, and scramble and interference competition. All predators exhibited a degree of crepuscular behaviour, supporting hypotheses relating to increased hunting success. Nocturnal predators exhibit decreased activity at the darkest times of night due to visual limitations. There was no support for the hypothesis that predators would be active at the same time as their main prey species. Although all members of the guild suffer intraguild predation, only subordinate members exhibited scramble competition avoidance by minimizing activity at the same times as their intraguild predators. Subordinate predators (wild dogs and cheetahs), frequently reported as suffering from kleptoparasitism, minimize simultaneous activity with major kleptoparasites (lions and spotted hyaenas). These latter top predators have high dietary overlap; however, they do not avoid interference competition by minimizing activity overlap. Thus, optimal activity patterns evolved to satisfy a diverse range of factors that differ amongst species. Competition avoidance is the primary cause of the temporal partitioning in activity between subordinate and top predators. Africa{\rq}s carnivores have also evolved morphological adaptations to their activity patterns reflecting the length of time they have occurred in sympatry.",

There are many reasons that explain the increasing interest for this class of composites due to the lightweight, high strength, high stiffness, good fatigue life, excellent corrosion resistance and low cost manufacturing. Moreover, a considerable effort is paid to improve the thermal/electrical conductivity and the electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of lightweight composites. It is well known that in operation, the engines of the aircraft generate a large amount of electrical current during start up. This electrical current is undesirable and must be conducted away. Otherwise, the electronic components need to be protected against electromagnetic waves produced by other sources placed inside or outside the aircraft. This paper concerns the state-of--the-art of the lightweight composites and deals with discussing solutions, new material recipes and testing results.

	abstract = "As limited prey availability and persecution by humans in response to livestock predation are key conservation concerns for the Cape leopard (Martins \& Martins 2006), the present study aimed to provide more information regarding their feeding habits. The first objective was to determine whether the Cape leopard was subject to a change in their prey base and how they responded to the change. This was established by comparison of their current diet in the Cederberg and Gamka Mountains, determined by using scat analysis techniques, with a previous dietary assessment (Norton et al. 1986). The second aim was to provide a preliminary assessment of the prey preference of the Cape leopard and examine the utility of camera trap surveys to determine leopard prey preference. Leopard diet in the Cederberg and Gamka Mountains consisted largely of small- (1-10 kg) and medium-sized (10-40 kg) mammals; rock hyraxes (Procavia capensis) and klipspringers (Oreotragus oreotragus) were key prey items. In terms of regional variation in leopard diet, there was a significant difference in the average weight of prey utilized in the Cederberg and Gamka Mountains. Despite the importance of prey availability of suitable size, their flexibility in terms of prey size utilization reflected their ability to switch to smaller prey to fulfil their dietary requirements, when prey is limited. The study suggested a dietary shift, with significant variation in prey species utilization in both regions. The shift did not appear to be in response to prey scarcity, but rather a reduction in key prey species, particularly the rock hyrax. The shift involved an increase in the number of species utilized, and only a very small increase in livestock predation in both areas. There was however no significant variation in prey size category utilization. This demonstrated their dietary flexibility, as well as the importance of suitable prey sizes rather than the presence of specific prey species to fulfil their dietary requirements. The camera trap survey revealed a strong correlation between the number of camera trap days and the number of photographs taken of identifiable species. Variation of this correlation between different habitats supported the notion that individual images are a better unit to determine sampling efficiency than trap days. The camera trap survey also showed that small rodent availability was underestimated by camera trap surveillance, which resulted in poor prey preference estimation. It was therefore suggested that camera trap surveys be restricted to the surveillance of larger prey species (> 1 kg). By excluding small rodents from the analysis, prey preference could be estimated for other species and prey size categories. Small- and medium-sized mammals were significantly preferred, whereas large mammals were significantly avoided by the Cape leopard.",

	abstract = "Leopards (Panthera pardus) are considered to have the most wide ranging distribution of all felids, but outside savanna habitats their ecology is poorly understood. To improve our knowledge on feeding habits of these elusive carnivores, we used telemetric data obtained by GPS-Plus collars of Vectronic Aerospace GmbH with included dual-axis accelerometers in the Cederberg Mountains of the Western Cape, South Africa. Apart from spatial use and activity pattern, hunting activity of a single female leopard was examined using a novel approach of combining both GPS cluster analysis and activity data obtained by acceleration measurement during June 2008 - July 2009. In total, 2588 GPS positions with a fix success of 87\% were obtained. The leopard avoided open flats and spent most time on rocky slopes of the Cederberg{\rq}s Fynbos section. During summer, tendencies of a crepuscular activity pattern were found, but shifted towards diurnality in winter. Within the GPS cluster investigation period of 254 days, 78 potential kill sites from GPS data records were identified. Fifty-four of these sites were investigated 171 ± 91 days (mean ± sd) after the potential predation event which resulted in the detection of prey remains at 31 sites and thus a success rate of 57.4 \%. The majority (76\%) of prey consisted of rock hyraxes Procavia capensis and klipspringers Oreotragus oreotragus, diurnal species that live in rugged terrain. We were not able to distinguish confirmed kill clusters from non-kill clusters using Generalized additive modeling (GAM) of activity data. However, there was a significant difference between the activity pattern at small-kill (rock hyrax, rock rabbit) sites and large-kill (antelope) sites. Furthermore, results of frequency analyses of activity data allowed the differentiation between feeding cluster and non-feeding activity outside clusters. The combination of different methods such as GPS telemetry and acceleration data provides a valuable means in regions like the rugged and largely inaccessible Cederberg Mountains, where direct observation and scat collection are difficult. However, future studies on the foraging ecology of leopards will require a larger sample size, shorter fix intervals and earlier field investigations.",

Accordingly, we initiated a study to assess the impact of several conservation interventions on the dynamics and persistence of a leopard (Panthera pardus) population in Phinda Private Game Reserve, South Africa. These included revisions of the statutory systems that regulate problem animal control and trophy hunting, and we instituted a program intended to reduce human--leopard conflict in the region. We compared demographic rates of radiocollared leopards from two sampling periods: a pre-treatment period prior to intervention, and a treatment period after intervention. The average annual mortality rate of the population decreased from 0.401 ± 0.070 to 0.134 ± 0.016, with fewer leopards killed by humans and in intraspecific clashes after intervention. The overall reproductive output of the population increased in the treatment period, although annual cub production was higher in the pre-treatment period. This was mainly due to larger litter sizes prior to intervention, which may have been a strategy used by female leopards to offset high levels of infanticide. Results from camera-trap surveys and a Leslie-matrix model indicated an increase in annual population growth rate (k) of 14--16\% after the implementation of conservation measures. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing both the numerical and functional components of population dynamics when managing large carnivores exposed to hunting or persecution.",

We used the most extensive data set so far compiled on leopards Panthera pardus to establish baseline reproductive parameters for females and to determine the demographic and environmental factors that affect their lifetime reproductive success. 3. We used comprehensive sightings reports and photographs from ecotourism lodges in the Sabi Sand Game Reserve, South Africa, to reconstruct life histories for 44 female leopards that gave birth to 172 litters over a 32-year period. 4. Leopards appeared to exhibit a birth pulse; most litters were born in the wet season, particularly in December. Mean age at ��first parturition (n = 26, mean +- standard error = 46 +- 2 months, range = 33--62) was older than previously recorded, possibly due to elevated intraspeci��fic competition. Average litter size was 1.9 +- 0.1 (n = 140, range = 1--3) and declined with maternal age. Age of litters at independence (n = 52, 19 +- 1 months, range = 9--31) was inversely related to prey abundance but did not affect the likelihood of recruitment of offspring. Interbirth intervals differed following successful litters (in which at least one cub survived to independence; n = 55, 25 +- 1 months, range = 14--39) and unsuccessful litters (n = 46, 11 +- 1 months, range = 4--36), as did the time taken to replace litters. 5. Variation in lifetime reproductive success was in��fluenced mainly by differences in cub survival, which was related to maternal age and vulnerability to infanticide. Cub survival (37\%) declined as females got older, perhaps because mothers relinquished portions of their home ranges to philopatric daughters. Male leopards were responsible for many (40\%) cub deaths and females appeared to adopt several strategies to counter the risk of infanticide, including paternity confusion and displaying a period of reduced fertility immediately after a resident male was replaced. 6. Our results suggest that the reproductive success of female leopards is regulated primarily by top-down processes. This should be taken into account in management decisions, particularly when managers are considering the implementation of invasive activities such as legal trophy hunting. Offspring survival was the most important variable affecting LRS, and predation (predominantly by male leopards, lions and spotted hyaenas) accounted for 91\% of cub mortality.",

Consequently, research often fails to contribute meaningfully to conservation outcomes. We use leopards Panthera pardus in South Africa to illustrate this mismatch between research and conservation priorities. A review of the scientific literature showed that leopard studies in South Africa focused disproportionately on basic research, particularly on leopard feeding ecology inside protected areas. Academics were responsible for most articles but avoided applied studies, even though they were published in higher impact journals and took less time to undertake. An assessment of active leopard projects further demonstrated that studies were clumped in areas of low conservation concern and most failed to publish their findings. Many projects were also funded by commercial volunteer programs with financial incentives for conducting research. We recommend that leopard researchers in South Africa and carnivore researchers more widely engage with practitioners to ensure the most pressing issues are addressed. Scientists must also situate their research in a broader conservation context and evaluate the outcomes of management decisions. Finally, continued funding and permissions for research should at a minimum be contingent on research outputs being published in the peer-reviewed literature.",

	abstract = "We used 44 months of radiotelemetry data to investigate the selection of feeding habitats by leopards in Phinda Private Game Reserve, South Africa. We assessed whether leopards hunted in certain habitats disproportionately to their availability and we investigated the factors influencing selection of feeding habitats. We also compared the number of kills and relative success rates of observed hunts in different vegetation types with available prey biomass and the degree of cover within each habitat. Leopards preferred hunting in habitats where prey was easier to catch rather than where prey was more abundant. However, in contrast to expectations, the apparent 'catchability' of prey was not proportional to the amount of cover provided by each habitat type. Instead, the probability of a kill occurring was greater in areas with intermediate cover levels, and these habitat types were favoured by leopards for hunting. There was no significant difference in the success rates of observed hunts in different habitats, suggesting that reduced detectability of prey in denser vegetation was the principal factor governing the decreased occurrence of kills there. Kleptoparasitism was relatively uncommon at Phinda, and there was no significant difference in the number of kills lost to other predators, or the likelihood of a carcass being hoisted in different vegetation types. Our results suggest that leopards are not 'supergeneralists' as widely portrayed and, at least in their choice of hunting habitat, show a degree of specialization that is previously undocumented. We suggest this is likely to influence local population densities and resilience to threats, and we discuss the need for fine-scale understanding of the species' ecological requirements in planning for its conservation.

Twenty-nine published and four unpublished studies of leopard diet that had relative prey abundance estimates associated with them were analysed from 13 countries in 41 different spatial locations or temporal periods throughout the distribution of the leopard. A Jacobs' index value was calculated for each prey species in each study and the mean of these was then tested against a mean of 0 using t or sign tests for preference or avoidance. Leopards preferentially prey upon species within a weight range of 10-40 kg. Regression plots suggest that the most preferred mass of leopard prey is 25 kg, whereas the mean body mass of significantly preferred prey is 23 kg. Leopards prefer prey within this body mass range, which occur in small herds, in dense habitat and afford the hunter minimal risk of injury during capture. Consequently, impala, bushbuck and common duiker are significantly preferred, with chital likely to also be preferred with a larger sample size from Asian sites. Species outside the preferred weight range are generally avoided, as are species that are restricted to open vegetation or that have sufficient anti-predator strategies. The ratio of mean leopard body mass with that of their preferred prey is less than 1 and may be a reflection of their solitary hunting strategy. This model will allow us to predict the diet of leopards in areas where dietary information is lacking, also providing information to assist wildlife managers and conservation bodies on predator carrying capacity and predator-prey interactions.",

The aims of the study were to ��find out whether leopards depend on livestock as a food resource on the ranch, and to quantify the economic impact of leopards on the livestock production systems. The density of leopards was estimated in three ways, and the biomass density of potential prey for leopards, both wild and domestic. Diet analysis of leopards revealed that leopards are not relying on livestock as an important food resource. To quantify the e�ffects of leopards, an approach used in the economic assessment of agricultural development schemes was adopted (Gittinger, 1982) and models were derived by following those criteria.

Mean aggregate home-range size for the three radio-collared jackals was 15.9 km2. Mean home-range size varied between seasons with a tendency for range expansion during winter. The first two radio-collared jackals had similar activity patterns and were most active at dawn and dusk.

The mean distance travelled per 24-hour period was 14.6 km. Time of day influenced movements considerably, with greater distances being moved during dawn and dusk. Extraterritorial excursions directed towards farmland were frequent and accounted for 21.1 \% (n = 66) of all radio relocations. Jackals in MNR utilized wooded cover for denning, predator avoidance and foraging. They did not use habitats according to their proportional availability in any season. In all sea- sons jackals used open savanna grassland, Croton/Combretum tree savanna, and seasonal floodplains less than expected from their availability, and used tree and bush savanna, semi-sweet mixed bushveld and agricultural areas much more than expected. Implications of space use by jackals on management and conservation are discussed. Consistent with findings of the present study, C. mesomelas in the Serengeti left their territories for water and to scavenge carcasses for short periods (Moehlman 1983), and thus had ranges somewhat larger than territories.",

	abstract = "To investigate the role of black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) as predators, we studied diet, prey selection, and predation impact of jackals on 2 game ranches in South Africa that differed in ungulate diversity and biomass. Results showed that large (>15 kg) ungulate species dominated jackal diets throughout the year on both the less diverse (range of ingested biomass across seasons = 39--78\%) and more diverse (26--69\%) game ranch. Other important food items included medium-sized mammals (1--3 kg; 1--26\%) and fruit (2--69\%), whereas small mammals comprised 3--11\% of ingested biomass across seasons on both sites. Jackals were not random in consumption of ungulates, and consumption patterns suggested jackals actively hunted certain species rather than consumed them as carrion. During ungulate birthing periods, jackals consumed almost exclusively those ungulate species that were hiders (i.e., fawns were hidden in tall vegetation away from herd) regardless of ungulate densities, suggesting that primarily fawns were preyed upon. Among hiders, there was a negative relationship (P < 0.01) between body size and percent of population consumed by jackals, indicating smaller species were more susceptible than larger species to jackal predation. Consequently, springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) were always selected over other ungulate species on both sites, and this species was the most impacted by jackal predation. In contrast, ungulate species that were followers (i.e., fawns immediately followed mothers within protection of the herd) were scarcely or not at all consumed by jackals, regardless of body size or density. Medium-sized mammals were selectively consumed over ungulates, and there was a negative relationship (P < 0.01) between consumption of berries and ungulates, indicating alternative food resources influenced consumption of ungulates on our study sites. Our results will help wildlife managers in Africa identify ungulate species susceptible to jackal predation, and can be used to develop management strategies for reducing jackal predation in areas where it is problematic.

@techreport{Bothma_2012,
	abstract = "Many small, domesticated livestock production units have become degraded ecosystems with a scarcity of natural prey for carnivores and such flocks are targeted by the carnivores as food resources at times. Such production of small, domesticated livestock is essentially an agricultural monoculture and has a severe impact on ecosystem productivity and functioning. The only viable way in which to reduce the impact of carnivores on flocks of small, domesticated livestock permanently is to eliminate the carnivore(s) totally on a regional or national level. This is economically impossible and ecologically undesirable to do. Functional ecosystems are productive and natural prey may partially or totally buffer small, domesticated livestock against depredation by carnivores. In such ecosystems carnivore populations form an interrelated web. Mainly some adult, territorial males in a carnivore population will become habitual killers of small, domesticated livestock. Unselective control programmes may do more harm than good, and when they also kill rare or threatened wildlife they become illegal. In a functional ecosystem wild herbivores can maintain substantial production levels despite the presence of carnivores because of the presence of natural defences against predation. Where such defence mechanisms have been lost in small, domesticated livestock flocks they should be compensated for by livestock husbandry practices that are based on ecosystem principles or be redeveloped through selective breeding. Predation by carnivores on small, domesticated livestock is most severe during the lambing season(s). Carnivores that weigh less than 14,5 kg preferentially kill prey animals that weigh less than them and are more energetically rewarding to hunt. The development of husbandry programmes for small, domesticated livestock on an ecosystem basis should be based on the interaction between three components: humans, carnivores, livestock and other herbivores. Generalizations are invalid and each programme should be based on the circumstances that prevail. There are many popular perceptions about the nature, scope, causes and remedies for small, domesticated livestock depredation but most of them are not supported by independent scientific studies. The average carnivore in Africa is prone to predation and ecological influence from 15 other types of carnivore at some stage of its life. (Reference needed!) Carnivore-livestock predation management through the control of carnivore numbers has been practised for centuries throughout the world but except for total extermination of the carnivores involved, it has failed in all the properly documented cases. The benefits of taking an holistic ecosystem approach to the husbandry of small, domesticated livestock should be built into financial management and animal husbandry plans. Small adaptations towards holistic livestock management can make substantial differences to the impact of carnivores on livestock and increase the ability of the habitat to support herbivores. Subsidisation from government sources to compensate the producers of small, domesticated livestock for losses that were caused by carnivores has not produced positive results in maintaining or increasing livestock production anywhere in the world. Some 16 common names in Afrikaans are known for the black-backed jackal in South Africa. This creates confusion and misconception in identifying those animals that are really responsible for depredation on small, domesticated livestock. Mated pairs demarcate defended ranges, the size of which depends on habitat quality, the intensity of human disturbance and the abundance of prey. In functional ecosystems these ranges are small with little overlap, exclude other black-backed jackals and limit overpopulation. Territory boundaries can break down temporarily at an abundant food source such as a large carcass and often creates misconceptions about black-backed jackal population densities. Young and highly productive black-backed jackals disperse up to 135 km away from their natal sites into ranges that have become vacant because of the natural or control-induced mortalities of black-backed jackals and this rapidly lead to population recovery. This limits the effectiveness of control programmes. Black-backed jackals are active by day and night when they are not being persecuted by humans but they become mainly nocturnally active when being persecuted. When the male member of a mated pair dies, the female cannot fend for the litter and herself, the litters will die and the female will disperse to find a new mate. The vacated range will soon be filled by young, dispersing black-backed jackals and the boundaries of the existing ranges are adjusted. The black-backed jackal has an opportunistic, omnivorous diet. It hunts and scavenges alone or in pairs for food but occasionally forms packs to hunt larger antelopes that are old, weak, sick or injured. Carcasses are detected by an acute sense of smell. The reproductive system of the black-backed jackal is one of obligatory monogamy and synchronized breeding in females. Litters of up to nine pups are born in the winter and early spring and fertility is high. Consequently a black- backed jackal population can recover rapidly from carnivore control programmes or epizootics. Depredation on the lambs of antelope and small, domesticated livestock is seasonal and happens when the lambs are small. Scats that contain the remains of small, domesticated livestock do not indicate whether the animal was freshly scavenged or hunted and may give a skewed impression. Among carnivores, black-backed jackals are preyed on by eagles, caracals, spotted hyenas, leopards and lions, but are usually competitively dominant over caracals. Black-backed jackals in turn prey on a variety of smaller carnivores and the kittens of the caracal. ??? Maybe habitat dependent? Its acute sense of smell makes the baiting and trapping of black-backed jackals difficult. The black-backed jackal is wary and cunning which often stops it from entering a trap or taking bait. Once a black-backed jackal has been involved in an unsuccessful attempt to trap or bait it, it will seldom repeat the experience and further trapping or baiting for control becomes almost impossible. To date all attempts at the control of black-backed jackal populations have failed. Holistic ecosystem husbandry of small, domesticated livestock is a viable alternative. Lethal approaches to the control of black-backed jackals include the use of coyote getters, packs of hunting hounds, leg-hold (gin) traps and digging out pups from dens to kill them. Except the latter one, all the methods are unselective in killing the target animal and will also kill many types of non-target animal. Oranjejag, one of the largest and oldest carnivore hunting groups in South Africa, could not succeed in controlling the black-backed jackal population in their region of operations over several decades of intensive effort. Their control efforts were unselective and they also killed almost three times as many Cape foxes and numerous African wildcats. In KwaZulu-Natal, the population of black-backed jackals stayed stable despite 15 consecutive years of hunting jackals with trained hounds. Hunting jackals from the air with the aid of helicopters is only effective for some animals that have not yet become so shy of the sound of a helicopter that they will hide or change their activity cycle following persecution. Data from 287 hunts of black-backed jackals with helicopters have shown that 62\% of the stomachs contained the remains of domesticated sheep. However, the unit costs per jackal should be calculated and compared with means of preventing the predation of jackals on small, domesticated livestock. Shooting black-backed jackals with the aid of spotlights is not an option because these jackals avoid persecution and bright lights. Poisoned baits that are laced with strychnine and Compound 1080 are at times used to control black-backed jackals during rabies epizootics but they create wide-ranging ecological problems because they are unselective. Poisoned collars can be fitted to domesticated livestock to kill any carnivore that attacks them. Such collars can be used in combination with carnivore-proof herding and overnight and maternity pens. The poison being used is lethal to humans and should be treated with care. Shock collars that are combined with baited shock stations have been tested experimentally on wolves in the USA. Their use requires a substantial investment in labour and infrastructure and the trapping of a carnivore to be able to fit the collar. Therefore its use is considered to be impractical and expensive. Natural predator defence behaviour can be bred into small, domesticated livestock by selectively removing those ewes immediately from the flock who fail to protect their lambs against attack by a carnivore. An ecosystem approach to animal husbandry that is combined with the use of livestock protection or herding guard dogs is considered to be the best option to limit the depredation of carnivores on small, domesticated livestock. When using livestock protection or herding guard dogs it requires patience, maintenance and understanding to train each dog and immediate results should not be expected. Common non-lethal methods to prevent depredation include re-establishing defence behaviour against carnivores in a flock through selective breeding, the use of contraceptive baits, using cage traps to capture and re-establish carnivores elsewhere, the use of aversion or repellent chemicals, warning collars that are linked to a cell phone and scaring methods such as loud noises that are transmitted intermittently. The caracal is a generalist feeder and they will kill small, domesticated livestock. However, the main food resource consists of small rodents, hyraxes, springhares and small antelope. Adult females with kittens mainly feed on rodents. The small herbivorous prey animals being killed are an ecological bonus to the producer of small, domesticated livestock as it increases the stocking capacity of the habitat for larger herbivores. Hyraxes are preyed upon in a density-dependent way and the caracal is the main regulator of hyrax populations in the Karoo. An adult caracal requires some 1 kg of food per day. In the southern Kalahari the caracal mainly killed sheep during the cold season lambing season when their natural prey base was reduced but springhares were the most common prey. The stomachs of caracals that are killed in small, domesticated sheep production regions show a variable evidence of sheep remains but sheep never form the major food source. The caracal preys upon several types of small carnivore including black- backed jackal pups and is preyed upon in turn by the lion, leopard and spotted hyena. The black-backed jackal will prey on caracal kittens and following large black-backed jackal eradication programmes the caracal population in an area will increase rapidly. Caracals are difficult to trap and the trapping success only is around 2\%. This makes trapping as a control measure uneconomical. However, when they are to be trapped the urine of a female in oestrus, or the fresh prey of a caracal can be used as bait. Baits that contain fish meal and decomposed blood and meat are sometimes successful too. Expandable poisoned collars that contain carbofuran or Compound 1080 and are fitted to the lambs of small, domesticated livestock will kill attacking caracals. However, Compound 1080 is a banned substance because it is also lethal to humans, while carbofuran that is spilled will kill scavengers. Some depredation by caracals on small, domesticated livestock can be prevented by following an ecosystem-based husbandry approach that ensures the creation of a sustainable prey resource especially during the lambing season(s). Such depredation can also be prevented by using livestock protection or guard herding dogs and other guard animals such as the donkey and llama. Repellent collars that prevent caracals from attacking small, domesticated livestock may be unsuitable for caracals because a caracal can bite through them as it has a strong jaw structure and musculature. Bell collars and those that contain aversion chemicals that cause irrational fear or dislike may also work. A collar that activates a distress call on a mobile phone has also been developed and used. (Expensive!) Herding small, domesticated livestock in overnight and maternity pens that are carnivore-proof will prevent depredation by caracals. The depredation impact of caracals can also be reduced through the selective breeding of ewes that show natural defence against carnivore attacks on their lambs. The lambs and lambing season(s) of small, domesticated livestock are critical components that can be protected by taking measures that prevent depredation. This sometimes only requires small adjustments to the husbandry approach that is being used.",

Yet this bright Maasai boy has devised an innovative solution that's helping the survival of these magnificent beasts -- by keeping them away from humans. Living on the edge of Nairobi National Park, in Kenya, Turere first became responsible for herding and safeguarding his family's cattle when he was just nine. But often, his valuable livestock would be raided by the lions roaming the park's sweet savannah grasses, leaving him to count the losses. "I grew up hating lions very much," says Turere, who is from Kitengela, just south of the capital Nairobi. "They used to come at night and feed on our cattle when we were sleeping." So, at the age of 11, Turere decided it was time to find a way of protecting his family's cows, goats and sheep from falling prey to hungry lions. I had to look after my dad's cows and make sure that they were safe. His light bulb moment came with one small observation. "One day, when I was walking around," he says, "I discovered that the lions were scared of the moving light." Turere realized that lions were afraid of venturing near the farm's stockade when someone was walking around with a flashlight. He put his young mind to work and a few weeks later he'd come up with an innovative, simple and low-cost system to scare the predators away. He fitted a series of flashing LED bulbs onto poles around the livestock enclosure, facing outward. The lights were wired to a box with switches and to an old car battery powered by a solar panel. They were designed to flicker on and off intermittently, thus tricking the lions into believing that someone was moving around carrying a flashlight.},

	abstract = "Context: Human--wildlife con��flict is a global problem and increasing worldwide as people and wildlife compete for limited resources. Con��flict between people and crocodiles, especially in Africa, is recognised as a serious problem. The people of the Chiawa Game Management Area are heavily dependent on the Zambezi River for several resources from potable water and irrigating ��fields to a source of food (subsistence and small-scale commercial ��fishing). Aims: To assess the spatial and temporal scale of human--crocodile con��flict (HCC) and identify associated factors, with a view to recommending mitigation measures. Methods: A questionnaire survey and Zambia Wildlife Authority data were utilised to estimate the scale of HCC. Key results: Between 2000 and 2009, there were 98 crocodile attacks on people, 62.2\% were fatal. Most of the attacks occurred while canoe ��fishing (57.1\%) and collecting water (29.6\%). Crocodiles were disliked and seen as a {\lq}problem{\rq} by the majority of the populace. Even though crocodiles are a charismatic mega-fauna species, being employed within the tourism industry had only a minor positive effect on people{\rq}s attitudes. The area is an important location for crocodile egg and adult harvesting, although the local population gains no ��financial bene��fit. An increase in the number of boreholes in the villages was suggested by the local people as the primary mitigation measure, as well as the removal of crocodiles by various means. Conclusions: Although people displayed an understanding of the risks of crocodile attack, very few actually employed mitigation techniques or utilised protective barriers when at the river. Increased water-access points (and their maintenance) in the villages would reduce people{\rq}s dependency on the river. The negative attitude towards crocodiles is an issue that has to be addressed to allow successful implementation of long-term conservation strategies.

	abstract = "Understanding why some species are at high risk of extinction, while others remain relatively safe, is central to the development of a predictive conservation science. Recent studies have shown that a species{\rq} extinction risk may be determined by two types of factors: intrinsic biological traits and exposure to external anthropogenic threats. However, little is known about the relative and interacting effects of intrinsic and external variables on extinction risk. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that extinction risk in the mammal order Carnivora is predicted more strongly by biology than exposure to high-density human populations. However, biology interacts with human population density to determine extinction risk: biological traits explain 80\% of variation in risk for carnivore species with high levels of exposure to human populations, compared to 45\% for carnivores generally. The results suggest that biology will become a more critical determinant of risk as human populations expand. We demonstrate how a model predicting extinction risk from biology can be combined with projected human population density to identify species likely to move most rapidly towards extinction by the year 2030. African viverrid species are particularly likely to become threatened, even though most are currently considered relatively safe. We suggest that a preemptive approach to species conservation is needed to identify and protect species that may not be threatened at present but may become so in the near future.",

	abstract = "Human-crocodile conflict is in many ways seen as an unwanted result of conservation policy measures (Western \& Waithaka 2004), which can be sourced in past protectionist approaches. Key mitigation factors that are outlined in this chapter include: (i) preventative techniques [education, zoning, livestock management, increasing wildlife values through consumptive (crocodile farming and ranching) and non-consumptive use (tourism)] and (ii) reactive techniques ({\lq}problem{\rq} animal control; lethal control or relocation and compensation). Suggestions or recommendations with regards to HCC in the Okavango Delta, Botswana were provided by local communities and analysed in a tabulated format. These recommendations were recorded in the last section of the questionnaire, as {\lq}suggested conflict resolution{\rq}. Most people within the sample did not provide any recommendations. However, it is interesting to note that only one person said that the presence of the Nile crocodile is good for tourism and another suggested that they should ``sell crocodiles''. These comments were the only ones listed indicating that people might derive a tangible benefit from crocodiles. It is important to note that the majority of people who provided recommendations (8.2\% of the sample) said that crocodiles should all be killed. Some interviewee{\rq}s reactions were very negative towards crocodile conservation with 8.2\% saying that all crocodiles should be killed and 3.3\% said that all crocodiles should be removed from the river. Some useful recommendations that could be applied are: guard livestock at water, people should stay away from the river, awareness of crocodiles at the river, more fences, help people when being attacked and livestock should be kept at the cattle-post away from the river. Passive methods include mitigation techniques that impede the access of problem animals into areas (eg. buffer zones, fences and early warning systems) and active methods are designed to frighten or chase away problem animals (e.g. fires and pepper spay for elephants) (Osborn \& Packer 2003). i. Cattle should be prevented from having open access to the river, as livestock should not roam freely around or near the river{\rq}s edge. This can be achieved through fencing them some distance away from the river. Fencing materials can be sourced from locally available thorn or acacia branches, or purchased in the form of wire and wooden poles. ii. Cattle should be preferably watered away from the river at cattle stations, boreholes and water abstraction points. iii. If i) \& ii) above are not possible, then specific fencing could be constructed at the rivers edge to allow for livestock to safely drink water. One option is suggested in Figure 5.1. The impenetrable fence can be made from solid poles or tall tree logs standing next to each other or out of lethaka reeds at a minimum height of 3meters and jutting out into the shallow water of the river in an arc shape from the river bank iv. Livestock guarding could occur when the livestock are drinking at the river, and one should be especially vigilant in the months of March, April, May and December when the possibility of attack is noted to be higher than other months.",

Our results have important implications for coyote management in urban areas. Abstract: Understanding and assessing the public{\rq}s attitudes towards urban wildlife is an important step towards creating management plans, increasing knowledge and awareness, and fostering coexistence between people and wildlife. We conducted a survey of undergraduate college students in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area---where coyotes are recent arrivals---to determine existing attitudes towards coyotes and coyote management methods. Amongst other findings, we found that the more a person feared coyotes, the less likely they were to support their presence (p < 0.001), and the less likely they were to believe that pet owners should be directly responsible for protecting their pets (p < 0.001). Respondents demonstrated major gaps in their understanding of basic coyote biology and ecology. Respondents broke wildlife management practices into two categories: those that involved an action on coyotes (both lethal or non-lethal; referred to as ``Coyote''), and those that restricted human behavior (referred to as ``Human''); the ``Human'' methods were preferred. We found important differences between key demographic groups in terms of attitudes and management preferences. Our study suggests that wildlife professionals have unique opportunities in urban areas to prevent and reduce conflict before it escalates, in part by targeting tailored outreach messages to various demographic and social groups. Another study found that a negative experience with an urban species increased negative feelings towards all species that are commonly thought to come into conflict with humans in urban areas. Men tend to be more tolerant of coyotes and less fearful of them than women, but tend to want coyote-aimed management ranther than human-aimed management.",

	abstract = "The mortality of water buffalo Bubalus bubalis and cattle Bos indicus and B. taurus associated with predation by jaguar Panthera onca and puma Puma concolor, both of which are categorized as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, was examined in six Venezuelan ranches. There was signi��ficantly higher cattle than buffalo mortality due to predators in all ranches. Compared to buffaloes, cattle had a greater risk of being predated. Variations in monthly predation were observed, with greater cattle mortality during the peak of the rainy season (June-July). Buffalo, but not cattle, displayed defensive behaviour against predators. We suggest that livestock mortality associated with jaguar and puma may be reduced by keeping buffaloes and cattle in the same paddock, or by keeping only buffalo. Reduction of cattle losses is needed to increase tolerance towards jaguar and puma and thus facilitate their conservation. B. bubalis has higher production than cattle in South American ��flooded tropical grasslands. However, buffalo kept as livestock have two limitations: (1) they may revert to their feral condition if not managed according to the requirements of the species, and (2) some markets pay low prices for buffalo meat or may be reluctant to consume buffalo products.",

	abstract = "Livestock Guarding Dogs Llamas Donkeys Bonding sheep and goats to cattle. The most common breeds used in the United States are Great Pyrenees, Akbash, and Komondor (Green and Woodruff, 1988; Andelt and Hopper, 2000), whereas the Anatolian Shepherd, Maremma, Shar Planinetz, and mixed breed dogs are used less frequently. Most guarding dogs weigh 75-100 pounds and are ≥ 25 inches at the shoulders. Successful guarding dogs are trustworthy (will not harm sheep), attentive to sheep, and aggressive toward predators (Coppinger et al., 1983). These traits are ``instinctive;'' they develop in most dogs with proper handling and minor training. Sheep producers in Colorado who did not use livestock guarding dogs lost 5.9 and 2.1 times greater proportions of lambs to predators than producers who had dogs in 1986 and 1993 (Andelt and Hopper, 2000). Predation on ewes and lambs decreased more from 1986 to 1993 for producers who obtained dogs between these years compared to producers who did not have dogs. A total of 125 producers in Colorado estimated that their 392 dogs reduced predation losses by $891,440 in 1993. Thirty-six producers in North Dakota reported guarding dogs reduced predation on sheep by 93% (Pfeifer and Goos, 1982). Producers in Colorado indicated that guarding dogs greater than 9 months of age saved more time in sheep management than the amount of time spent feeding and working with each dog (Andelt, 1992). Overall, guarding dogs are a cost effective means of reducing predation (Green et al., 1984; Andelt and Hopper, 2000). Disadvantages of guarding dogs include some dogs not staying with or harassing sheep, some dogs, especially Komondors, being overly aggressive toward people (Green and Woodruff, 1988; Andelt, 1992), and the dogs can be subject to injury and premature death. Many of the disadvantages are relatively uncommon. Most producers surveyed feel strongly that the advantages of their dogs far outweigh the disadvantages. Advantages of donkeys and llamas over guarding dogs include less prone to accidental death, longer-lived, do not require special feeds, stay in the same pasture as sheep, apparently do not need to be raised with sheep, more compatible with other depredation control techniques, such as traps, snares, M-44s (sodium cyanide injectors), and livestock protection collars, and donkeys are cheaper than guarding dogs. Alternately, guarding dogs deter predators in fenced pastures and on open range, whereas llamas and donkeys appear most effective in fenced pastures < 300 acres. Guarding dogs are effective in deterring bear and mountain lion predation (Green and Woodruff, 1989; Andelt and Hopper, 2000), whereas some donkeys (Green, 1989) and possibly llamas are afraid of bears and mountain lions. Although one early report indicated that guarding dogs could protect cattle from wolf predation (Coppinger et al., 1988), and were fairly effective in keeping wolves and black bears from carrion feeding sites in Minnesota (Coppinger et al., 1987), wolves have killed some domestic dogs (Fritts and Paul, 1989; Bangs et al., 1998), and dogs may serve to attract wolves to livestock under some circumstances. However, guarding animals are not a cure for all problems with predators. Their effectiveness is influenced by a variety of factors and their use requires a commitment by their owners. Some livestock producers continue to require other animal damage-control measures in addition to guarding animals. $",

	abstract = "The use of livestock guarding dogs (LGDs) to mitigate farmer-predator conflict in Namibia was evaluated. As farmer-predator conflict has two sides, LGDs were evaluated in terms of livestock production and conservation. The main objectives in terms of livestock production were to document: 1) the perceived ability of LGDs to reduce livestock losses in a cost-effective manner; 2) the farmers{\rq} satisfaction with LGD performance; and 3) factors influencing LGD behaviour. The main objectives in terms of conservation were to record: 1) predator killing by farmers relative to LGD introduction; 2) direct impacts of LGDs on target (damage-causing) species; and 3) the impact of LGDs on non-target species. This evaluation was conducted on LGDs bred by the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) and placed on farms in Namibia. The data were collected during face-to-face interviews with farmers using LGDs. Historical data from the CCF programme were used in conjunction with a complete survey of the farmers in the CCF LGD programme during 2009-2010. In terms of livestock production, 91\% of the LGDs (n = 65) eliminated or reduced livestock losses. Subsequently, 73\% of the farmers perceived their LGDs as economically beneficial, although a cost-benefit analysis showed that only 59\% of the LGDs were cost-effective. Farmers were generally satisfied with the performance of their LGDs. However, farmer satisfaction was more closely linked to good LGD behaviour than the perceived reduction in livestock losses. The most commonly-reported LGD behavioural problems (n = 195) were staying at home rather than accompanying the livestock (21\%) and chasing wildlife (19\%). LGD staying home behaviour was linked to a lack of care on subsistence farms, as high quality dog food was not consistently provided. Care for LGDs declined with LGD age on subsistence, but not commercial, farms. In terms of conservation, predator-killing farmers killed fewer individuals in the year since LGD introduction than previously; this result was only significant for black-backed jackal Canis mesomelas. However, 37 LGDs killed jackals, nine killed baboons Papio ursinus, three killed caracals Caracal caracal and one killed a cheetah Acinonyx jubatus (n = 83). Farmers and LGDs combined killed significantly more jackals in the survey year than the same farmers (n = 36) killed before LGD introduction. Conversely, five farmers killed 3.2 ± 2.01 cheetahs each in the year before LGD introduction, whereas LGDs and these farmers combined killed only 0.2 ± 0.2 cheetahs per farm in the survey year. Only 16 LGDs (n = 83) killed non-target species. The high LGD success rate in terms of livestock production was facilitated by livestock husbandry practices in the study area. In terms of conservation, LGDs were more beneficial for apex predators than for mesopredators and had a minor impact on non-target species. As the prevalence of behavioural problems and their prevention has been a focus of the CCF programme (Schumann 2003), more detailed analyses were conducted on the possible reasons for these problems. The unexpectedly high prevalence of behavioural problems in the 39-63 months age category in the current study was hypothesized to be linked to the lack of herders and/or a change in herder. It was further hypothesized that the specific problems of staying at home or chasing wildlife may be more prevalent among dogs that receive less care. The trustworthiness score for the dogs in all age categories was not affected by the presence of a herder (U = 2626, z = -0.06, p = 0.95, n = 164), nor whether the herder was changed or not. The expected effects of herder presence and/or changing herders on LGD trustworthiness could not be conclusively established in this study due to small sample sizes. A high quality herder would be expected to prevent both staying at home and chasing wildlife behaviours (Schumann 2003). The opposite may be true for a low quality herder that does not work well with the dog and/or encourages wildlife-chasing behaviour (Schumann 2003). Investigating herder quality in relation to the development of these behaviour problems would therefore be an avenue for future research.",

@article{Howery_n_DeLiberto_2004,
	abstract = "Laundr{\'e} et al. (2001) suggested that behavioral responses by prey species to impending predation might have more far-reaching consequences for ungulate behavioral ecology than the actual killing of individuals by predators. Potential negative, indirect impacts associated with the mere presence of predators include, but are not limited to, increased vigilance and reduced foraging efficiency by prey species, and being forced by predators to forage in suboptimal habitats that contain lower quality or quantity of nutrients, and higher levels of toxins. Moreover, overuse of and lowered carrying capacity in suboptimal habitats could contribute to resource degradation (e.g., overgrazing in marginal habitats, increased erosion and sedimentation) and lower producer profits due to declines in livestock production (e.g., weight gain, body condition, lamb or calf crop). Thus, indirect impacts of predation may have negative impacts on the ecological integrity of the land, as well as negative impacts on personal, local, and regional economies that depend on livestock production. However, there is little or no published information that addresses indirect effects of carnivores on domestic ungulates. Foraging efficiency is generally higher in the absence of predators because ungulates are not hindered from selecting diets from habitats that contain high nutrient densities and low toxin levels (Laundr{\'e} et al., 2001). Foraging in high-quality, predator-free habitats affords prey species the opportunity to exhibit maximum selectivity among nutritious plants and plant parts. Conversely, when herbivores sense or encounter predators, foraging efficiency may decrease due to increased vigilance and corresponding lower intake in high-quality habitats, increased energy expenditures caused by avoidance or escape maneuvers, or by being forced into lower-quality habitats where nutrients are less available and less digestible (Lima and Dill, 1990). Decreased animal production could result due to any of these scenarios. Risenhoover and Bailey (1985) reported that foraging efficiency of mountain sheep was positively related to group size, and that foraging groups of more than ten animals appeared to be a behavioral adaptation enabling sheep to use less secure habitats. Frid (1997) reported that Dall sheep (Ovis dalli) became less vigilant as group size increased, while California bighorn sheep groups consisting of five or less individuals had lower foraging efficiency than larger groups because of more interruptions to scan the environment, i.e., increased vigilance (Berger, 1978). Some ungulates have been observed to form ``nurseries'' to cooperatively guard offspring while mother forages. For example, lactating Nubian ibexes (Capra ibex) selected richer feeding areas, spent more time feeding per day, and foraged further from escape cover when their young were cached in a ``nursery'' compared to lactating females with young at heel (Kohlmann et al., 1996). The establishment of nurseries apparently allowed lactating ibex to select and consume more nutritious diets while other herd members protected their young from predators. In eastern Arizona, where calf losses to wolves on one ranch were estimated to be 50\% in 2002, cattle were observed to huddle and move together in smaller groups (Darcy Ely, personal communication). Cattle ``were always on the move and never in the same area during a 24- hour period'' while grazing an 8,000-acre pasture in wolf country (Darcy Ely, personal communication). Other behaviors observed included increased vigilance, cows running through fence lines, cows fighting wolves to protect their calves, diarrhea, increased stillborns and abortions, and cows and calves running from domestic cow dogs after being exposed to wolves. When sheep are herded they are apparently afforded more protection from predators than cattle because herders can move sheep out of areas with predator problems. However, predator attacks still occur at night when sheep are bedded (Mark Pedersen, personal communication). Sheep pursued by predators at night likely suffer from exhaustion and weight loss, which can negatively influence forage intake and reproductive performance of both males and females. Rams need food and rest to service 50 to 60 ewes, and ewes that lose weight may not cycle or carry lambs to term compared to rested animals (Mark Pedersen, personal communication). When a band of 2,000 sheep are chased by predators they move ``shoulder to shoulder like an amoeba'' which can damage soils and vegetation, especially when wet (Mark Pedersen, personal communication). In addition to increased energy expenditure as a result of being harassed by predators at night, animals also have less time to ruminate, which can reduce digestibility of plant material harvested earlier. Thus, harassment by predators may directly cause weight loss due to increased energy expenditure associated with running and loss of sleep, but may also indirectly reduce the ability of ruminants to convert plant nutrients into weight gain due to decreased rumination time. More research is needed to better understand the potential impacts of indirect, nonlethal predation on domestic livestock behavior and production. Increased understanding could allow managers to manipulate animals, forage, and habitats in ways that lower both the direct and indirect effects of predation, increase livestock production, and that prevent herbivore distribution problems that may cause resource degradation (Howery et al., 1996, 1998b).",

	abstract = "Alleviating human--carnivore con��flict is central to large carnivore conservation and is often of economic importance, where people co-exist with carnivores. However, effective conflict mitigation requires knowledge of underlying human and environmental drivers that is largely absent in South Africa. From 2006 to 2008, we interviewed land owners in the North West Province of South Africa to quantify; (1) human--carnivore con��flict characteristics and (2) determinants of perceived predation levels and retaliatory persecution of carnivores. Carnivores reportedly killed 3755 animals, i.e. 2.77\% of total game and livestock holdings. Reported ��financial losses were unevenly distributed among individuals, but generally not of suf��ficient magnitude to constitute a serious economic threat. Dense cover, increasing distance from protected areas and land use were the most influential determinants of perceived predation levels. Cultural group was by far the most influential determinant of carnivore persecution. Black-backed jackals and caracals were most often implicated in predation and most frequently killed by interviewees. Con��flict in the North West Province appears to be driven more by social and environmental factors than by economic losses.

@techreport{Hunter_et_al_2013,
	abstract = "Free-ranging African lions (Panthera leo) have declined over the last century, and particularly in recent decades, to fewer than 35,000 today (Riggio et al., 2012). Lion decline is driven primarily by the conversion of savanna habitat to support people and the associated loss of prey and killing of lions by pastoralists in defence of their livestock (IUCN, 2006; Riggio et al., 2012). Among other potential threats, the effect of trophy hunting on lions is controversial. Practitioners whose primary concern is the welfare of individual animals contend that hunting is unequivocally negative and advocate for its cessation, whereas those whose primary concern is the status of populations suggest that hunting has the potential to confer both positive and negative impacts on lions, and question whether bans achieve intended conservation outcomes. In response to this uncertainty, we initiated a consensus-building process among published scientists with expertise in conservation and management of wild lions. Our objectives were to evaluate the impacts of trophy hunting on lions, identify the key problems in its management and evaluate the potential consequences, negative or positive, of banning the practice. Finally, we sought to establish clear science-based standards by which sustainable hunting of lions could be achieved. Here we present a summary of that consensus. 1) Systematic means of establishing lion quotas are rarely applied, partly because population monitoring is rarely undertaken. Accordingly, quotas are often established with little scientific oversight and with few safeguards for sustainability. 2) Quotas and off-takes are too high in many areas. Documented negative population-level impacts resulting from hunting demonstrate that quotas and harvests are higher than populations can sustain in several countries. 3) {\lq}Fixed quotas{\rq} are in place in several countries, whereby operators are charged for a proportion (30-100\%) of the total quota, irrespective of whether animals are actually hunted. Fixed quota fees are likely to encourage utilization of the entire fixed portion of the quota regardless of sustainability. 4) Restrictions on the age of lions that may be hunted are only applied in Tanzania, western Zimbabwe, and Niassa National Reserve in Mozambique (though such restrictions have been drafted in the provisional lion action plan for Benin; P. Henschel pers. comm.). 5) Hunting of females is permitted in Namibia and Zimbabwe. Female mortality is likely to further exacerbate the perturbation effect of hunting males due to the loss of the most productive portion of the population and the risk of dependent cubs dying when mothers are killed (Mosser and Packer, 2009). Essential Reforms Needed for the Management of Lion Hunting 1. Implementation and Enforcement of the 6-year rule on lion trophies in all range states. Based on dynamics of the Serengeti lion population, the restriction of trophy harvests to males of six-years or older effectively ensures sustainability of harvest in the absence of reliable population monitoring (Whitman et al., 2004). 2. Introduction of independent trophy monitoring and adaptive management of quotas. Given the lack of precise data on most lion population sizes, the development of a standardized monitoring programme for lion hunting and of lion trophies is essential to allow for adaptive quota management. A variety of indices should be measured, at a minimum, hunt effort for successful and unsuccessful hunts, and the age of animals killed. To be effective, monitoring programmes require that the submission of hunt effort and trophy quality data is mandatory and strictly enforced by being a prerequisite for receiving an export permit. In the interests of objectivity and transparency, this monitoring should be conducted by independent, scientific bodies with relevant expertise, for example, from academia and some conservation NGOs. 3. Implementation of maximum quotas to prevent excessive harvests, until age restrictions and trophy monitoring are in place. Until such time as age restrictions and trophy monitoring are implemented, we recommend that quota caps should be imposed as a precautionary measure. Packer et al. (2011) estimated that maximum harvests of 0.5 lions per 1,000 km2/386 sq mi in general or 1.0 per 1,000 km2/386 sq mi in areas with high densities of lions are conservative and likely to be sustainable in most cases. 4. Restriction of harvest to males. We believe that trophy harvest should be restricted to males, except in exceptional situations where the express management intention is to reduce the density of lions, as may occur in certain scenarios where lions occur on communal or private lands. 5. Abolish fixed quota fees for lions. Operators should not be required to pay for lions before they hunt them. Such requirements impose an incentive to shoot even if a sufficiently old lion is not found. 6. Development of a unified approach to the management of lion hunting. We recommend that a unified approach is developed for the management of trophy hunting among all 11 countries where lions are hunted as trophies. Such a unified approach would mean that the negative ecological impacts of lion hunting would be reduced across all areas in which lions are hunted. In addition, no single country would be disproportionately disadvantaged by the reforms. 7. Particular care required in West and Central Africa. In West Africa, where lions are considered regionally endangered on the IUCN Red List (Bauer \& Nowell, 2004), and populations are declining and becoming increasingly isolated (Henschel et al., 2010), reforms of the current hunting practices are most urgently required. We believe that reforms are preferable to trade restrictions due to the collateral long-term risks associated with the latter. We urge the USFWS to grant African governments the opportunity to improve the management of lion hunting, acknowledging the important steps already made by some to improve its sustainability and contribute to conservation goals. The failure of African governments to adopt the necessary reforms in a rapid and reasonable time frame (for example, three years) would create a strong case for trade restrictions.",

	abstract = "The trophy hunting of lions Panthera leo is contentious due to uncertainty concerning conservation impacts and because of highly polarised opinions about the practice. African lions are hunted across at least ,558,000 km2, which comprises 27--32\% of the lion range in countries where trophy hunting of the species is permitted. Consequently, trophy hunting has potential to impart significant positive or negative impacts on lions. Several studies have demonstrated that excessive trophy harvests have driven lion population declines. There have been several attempts by protectionist non-governmental organisations to reduce or preclude trophy hunting via restrictions on the import and export of lion trophies. We document the management of lion hunting in Africa and highlight challenges which need addressing to achieve sustainability. Problems include: unscientific bases for quota setting; excessive quotas and off-takes in some countries; fixed quotas which encourage over-harvest; and lack of restrictions on the age of lions that can be hunted. Key interventions needed to make lion hunting more sustainable, include implementation of: enforced age restrictions; improved trophy monitoring; adaptive management of quotas and a minimum length of lion hunts of at least 21 days. Some range states have made important steps towards implementing such improved management and off-takes have fallen steeply in recent years. For example age restrictions have been introduced in Tanzania and in Niassa in Mozambique, and are being considered for Benin and Zimbabwe, several states have reduced quotas, and Zimbabwe is implementing trophy monitoring. However, further reforms are needed to ensure sustainability and reduce conservation problems associated with the practice while allowing retention of associated financial incentives for conservation.",

	abstract = "Successful conservation of large terrestrial mammals (wildlife) on private lands requires that landowners be empowered to manage wildlife so that benefits outweigh the costs. Laikipia County, Kenya, is predominantly unfenced, and the land uses in the area allow wide-ranging wildlife to move freely between different management systems on private land. We used camera traps to sample large mammals associated with 4 different management systems (rhinoceros sanctuaries, no livestock; conservancies, intermediate stocking level; fenced ranches, high stocking level; and group ranches, high stocking level, no fencing, pastoralist clan ownership) to examine whether management and stocking levels affect wildlife. We deployed cameras at 522 locations across 8 properties from January 2008 through October 2010 and used the photographs taken during this period to estimate richness, occupancy, and relative abundance of species. Species richness was highest in conservancies and sanctuaries and lowest on fenced and group ranches. Occupancy estimates were, on average, 2 and 5 times higher in sanctuaries and conservancies as on fenced and group ranches, respectively. Nineteen species on fenced ranches and 25 species on group ranches were considered uncommon (occupancy < 0.1). The relative abundance of most species was highest or second highest in sanctuaries and conservancies. Lack of rights to manage and utilize wildlife and uncertain land tenure dampen many owners{\rq} incentives to tolerate wildlife. We suggest national conservation strategies consider landscape-level approaches to land-use planning that aim to increase conserved areas by providing landowners with incentives to tolerate wildlife. Possible incentives include improving access to ecotourism benefits, forging agreements to maintain wildlife habitat and corridors, resolving land-ownership conflicts, restoring degraded rangelands, expanding opportunities for grazing leases, and allowing direct benefits to landowners through wildlife harvesting. Methods: We used the number of independent photo- graphic events per 100 trap days as a relative abundance index (RAI). We used single-season occupancy analyses to estimate relative species richness (ϕ) (Cam et al. 2000; O{\rq}Brien et al. 2011), probability of detecting a species if it was present (p), and effect of covariates on ϕ and p. Relative species richness is alpha diversity/gamma diversity (i.e., the proportion of a regional pool of species represented at a site). We assumed that 64 species of mammals (Supporting Information) represented regional species richness. Because mammal body size can affect detection by the camera sensor, we considered the z-score of body mass as a covariate for detection probability. We used z-scores of number of days camera traps were active as a covariate of sampling effort. We used program PRESENCE 3.1 (Hines 2008) for all analyses of species richness. We analyzed management types separately because the combined model failed to converge numerically due to the large numbers of possible detection histories with very small probabilities (J. E. Hines, personal communication).",

Using detailed data on livestock predation in the Maasai steppe landscape in Northern Tanzania, I investigated how prey preference, location and timing of livestock attacks contributed to the vulnerability of lions, leopards and spotted hyenas to retaliatory killing. Lions mostly preyed upon adult cattle and donkeys. In contrast, hyenas and leopards primarily killed small stock (goat, sheep and calves) and dogs. Hyenas and leopards mostly attacked livestock at night, whereas lions often attacked grazing livestock during the daytime. These behaviors made lions the most vulnerable to direct retaliatory killing, although some villages speci��fically targeted hyenas with poison, and the cultural traditions of pastoralists also exacerbate the retaliatory killing of lions.

	abstract = "Recent studies indicate that trophy hunting is impacting negatively on some lion populations, notably in Tanzania. In 2004 there was a proposal to list lions on CITES Appendix I and in 2011 animal-welfare groups petitioned the United States government to list lions as endangered under their Endangered Species Act. Such listings would likely curtail the trophy hunting of lions by limiting the import of lion trophies. Concurrent efforts are underway to encourage the European Union to ban lion trophy imports. We assessed the significance of lions to the financial viability of trophy hunting across five countries to help determine the financial impact and advisability of the proposed trade restrictions. Lion hunts attract the highest mean prices (US$24,000--US$71,000) of all trophy species. Lions generate 5--17\% of gross trophy hunting income on national levels, the proportional significance highest in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia. If lion hunting was effectively precluded, trophy hunting could potentially become financially unviable across at least 59,538 km2 that could result in a concomitant loss of habitat. However, the loss of lion hunting could have other potentially broader negative impacts including reduction of competitiveness of wildlife-based land uses relative to ecologically unfavourable alternatives. Restrictions on lion hunting may also reduce tolerance for the species among communities where local people benefit from trophy hunting, and may reduce funds available for anti-poaching. If lion off-takes were reduced to recommended maximums (0.5/1000 km2), the loss of viability and reduction in profitability would be much lower than if lion hunting was stopped altogether (7,005 km2). We recommend that interventions focus on reducing off-takes to sustainable levels, implementing age-based regulations and improving governance of trophy hunting. Such measures could ensure sustainability, while retaining incentives for the conservation of lions and their habitat from hunting.",

	abstract = "Changing land use patterns in southern Africa have potential to dramatically alter the prospects for carnivore conservation. Understanding these influences is essential for conservation planning. We interviewed 250 ranchers in Namibia to assess human tolerance towards and the distribution of large carnivores. Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), leopards (Panthera pardus) and brown hyaenas (Hyaena brunnea) were widely distributed on Namibian farmlands, spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) had a narrower distribution, and wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) and lions (Panthera leo) are largely limited to areas near source populations. Farmers were most tolerant of leopards and least tolerant of lions, wild dogs and spotted hyaenas. Several factors relating to land use correlated consistently with carnivore-presence and landowner tolerance. Carnivores were more commonly present and/or tolerated where; wildlife diversity and biomass were higher; income from wildlife was higher; income from livestock was lower; livestock biomass was lower; in conservancies; game fencing was absent; and financial losses from livestock depredation were lower. Efforts to create conditions whereby the costs associated with carnivores are lowest, and which confer financial value to them are likely to be the most effective means of promoting carnivore conservation. Such conditions are achieved where land owners pool land to create conservancies where livestock are replaced with wildlife (or where livestock husbandry is improved) and where wildlife generates a significant proportion of ranch income. Additional measures, such as promoting improved livestock husbandry and educational outreach efforts may also help achieve coexistence with carnivores. Our findings provide insights into conditions more conducive to the persistence of and tolerance towards large carnivores might be increased on private (and even communal) lands in Namibia, elsewhere in southern and East Africa and other parts of the world where carnivore conservation is being attempted on private lands.",

	abstract = "Namibia has the largest remaining population of free-ranging cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus ) in the world, 90\% of which are found outside protected areas on commercial farms. We conducted a baseline survey of Namibian farmers between 1991 and 1993, with a yearly follow-up thereafter until 1999, to quantify the perceptions of farmers toward cheetahs. Specifically, we sought to identify factors that cause cheetahs to be perceived as pests and management practices that mitigate this perception. The baseline survey revealed that farmers who regarded cheetahs as problems removed an average of 29 cheetahs annually, whereas those who did not consider them problematic removed a mean of 14 annually. These figures dropped significantly to 3.5 and 2.0 cheetahs per year after the introduction of educational materials. The perception that cheetahs are pests was significantly associated with game farms, and the presence of ``play trees'' on farms emerged as a significant corollary of both negative perceptions and removals of cheetahs. Between 1991 and 1999, the mean annual number of cheetah removals significantly decreased from 19 to 2.1. Late in the study, cheetah killing was more closely correlated with perceived problems than in the early years of the study. These findings suggest that although cheetahs are still perceived as a problem, farmers{\rq} tolerance toward cheetahs has increased. Management strategies and economic in- centives that promote cheetah conservation, such as the formation of conservancies, development of ecotourism, and marketing of ``predator-friendly'' meat, are essential for conserving cheetahs outside protected areas.",

@incollection{Nyhus_et_al_2005,
	abstract = {As the cases in this volume vividly illustrate, human conflict with wildlife is a significant---and growing---conservation problem around the world. The risk of wildlife damage to crops, livestock, and human lives provides incentives for rural residents to kill wildlife and to reduce the quantity and quality of habitat on private and communal lands. Recognition among conservationists that the cost of conserving large and sometimes dangerous animals is often borne disproportionately by farmers and others living closest to wildlife has spawned strategies to reduce this imbalance. One popular response is to compensate rural residents for the costs of wildlife damage. By spreading the economic burden and moderating the financial risks to people who co-exist with wildlife, conservationists hope to reduce the negative consequences of human-wildlife conflict. Few systematic efforts have been made to evaluate the efficacy of these programs or the best way to implement and manage these schemes for endangered species (Sillero-Zubiri \& Laurenson, 2001). In this chapter, we build on our recent study (Nyhus et al., 2003) that asked whether compensation programs really help endangered species in conflict with humans. We surveyed 23 international experts in large mammal conservation to learn about common pitfalls associated with running a compensation program and the resources managers need to succeed. Here, we also draw on additional published studies and reviews to explore the role of compensation in resolving conflicts between people and wildlife. We analyze the prospects and challenges of using these schemes in both developed and developing countries as part of a comprehensive suite of approaches to mitigate the effects of human-wildlife conflict on the long-term survival of endangered species. We also introduce the idea of performance payments and other alternatives to traditional compensation schemes. Pitfalls: 1. Verifying damage (under- and over-compensation) Incentive to attribute losses to carnivores. 2. Delayed verification or too high standards for verification (under-compensation) 3. Transparent payment process. 4. Maintaning compensation programme (sustainability). Failure or premature end result in more negativity than nothing at all. 5. Costs of verifying/running compensation programme. 6. "Perverse incentive" - Moral hazard (Farmers don't protect livestock because of compensation). 7. Compensation as agricultural subsidy (unsustainable practices or habitats because of compensation). 8. Conflict withing or among communities. 9. Private insurance: The difficulties associated with verifying damage and farmer investments in damage-avoidance are substantial and thus lead to problems of fraudulent claims, moral hazard, and adverse selection. Adverse selection occurs when insurance agents cannot differentiate high-risk from low-risk clients and thus cannot provide insurance to low-risk clients at a reasonable price. 10. Insurance too expensive compared to alternatives (like killing predators). 11. Insurance may need still extra funding to be viable (E.g. Community/conservancy-based Project Snow Leopard). 12. Measuring success: Even when compensated, farmers may continue to kill wildlife illegally. 13. Alternatives, such as tourism or trophy hunting, (or fencing) may potentially provide better investments in time, money, and results. 14. Performance payments: Rather than compensate rural residents for wildlife damage, practitioners may want to consider making payments that are conditional on wildlife abundance. Same problems of verification and payment speed. 15. In the case of wide-ranging wildlife, to whom should go the rewards for the protection of a particular animal? Conclusion: Corruption inhibits transparency. Insufficient funding precludes fair payment. Inadequate staff and training impede accurate verification. Ultimately, compensation is only one tool in the human-wildlife conflict mitigation toolbox. Fischer: Defenders of Wildlife made its first compensation payment in 1987 and by 1992 established a permanent fund to pay for verified livestock losses in the northern Rockies and later the Southwest. This was the first private compensation program for wolves established in North America. Here{\rq}s how the program works. If a rancher believes a wolf has killed his livestock, he contacts the appropriate government agency. A trained biologist, usually on the scene within 48 hours, investigates to determine whether wolves were responsible. If the investigator verifies that wolves killed the livestock, Defenders is notified. Defenders strives to get cheques to ranchers within 2-4 weeks of receiving verification of a loss. When ranchers were concerned about unverified losses, Defenders established a category for ``probable'' losses, for which it compensates livestock producers at half the market value.},

Sport hunting is an inherently risky strategy for controlling predators as carnivore populations are difficult to monitor and some species show a propensity for infanticide that is exacerbated by removing adult males. Simulation models predict population declines from even moderate levels of hunting in infanticidal species, and harvest data suggest that African countries and U.S. states with the highest intensity of sport hunting have shown the steepest population declines in African lions and cougars over the past 25 yrs. Similar effects in African leopards may have been masked by mesopredator release owing to declines in sympatric lion populations, whereas there is no evidence of overhunting in non-infanticidal populations of American black bears. Effective conservation of these animals will require new harvest strategies and improved monitoring to counter demands for predator control by livestock producers and local communities.",

Herding Techniques and Breed Selection It is clear that the predator ``problem'' is an economic, or potential economic, problem to the livelihood of livestock farmers. The solution therefore needs to be at least partly economic whereby incentives will negate the predator persecution by livestock farmers. Those incentives are created through the effective and acceptable mitigation measures as detailed in this manual. The fact that these measures are ecologically acceptable, humane and ethical would add value to the produce, thereby qualifying the producer to sell his produce as wildlife--friendly, enabling him to earn a premium. The incentives are derived from the improved yield in production (through the mitigation measures proposed here) and from the value achieved at the market by qualifying as a wildlife-friendly brand. This manual has focused largely on acceptable mitigation measures (guarding techniques, deterrent mechanisms or improved animal husbandry practices) whereby agricultural produce can be protected against predation. The code of practice for improved predator management on rangeland livestock farms that would be acceptable as production standards in the development of the proposed wildlife--friendly brand, has been discussed. The development of the production practices described is relevant to the market into which the products are to be released, and thus the development of the wildlife--friendly brand or label. This manual is part of the Landmark Foundation‟s development of the market mechanisms to help solve the livestock--predator conundrum. This is a three--phased process: - Firstly the development of a Code of Practice (contained herein) which producers would sign up for; - Secondly the implementation of the recommendations and the mitigation measures contained in this manual of holistic, ecologically acceptable and humane productions practices; and - Thirdly the development of an independent (of producer and retailer) monitoring and evaluation system by which the brand can get accredited and audited, and thus labelled.",

There is an increasing need to understand interspecific and geographic differences in patterns of crop-raiding. Here, focussing on macaques, a group of primates that feature high on the list of crop-raiders throughout Asia, we calculate incidence rates (IRs; the proportion of farms where a particular crop is raided by macaques in relation to the total number of farms where this crop is grown and available to macaques) for different crops and relate this to physical and temporal features. Based on interview data from 120 farmers in 3 Village Development Committees in Lantang National Park in Nepal, IRs were highest for potato (0.783) and maize (0.697) and lower for cereals (0.353 and 0.357 for buckwheat and millet, respectively), and IRs of 4 crops were negatively related to the distance to the forest edge. IRs for potato and maize were close to 1 near the forest edge but dropped significantly when the distance between the forest edge and fields exceeded 150 and 400 m, respectively. Farmers mostly employed benign crop-deterrent tactics, but macaques disproportionally raided farms in the early hours of the day, presumably to avoid conflict with farmers. Comparisons with IRs from other macaque species from Sri Lanka and Indonesia show that IRs are not related to caloric or nutritional content of crops or to the quantities in which crops are grown. With respect to the management of macaques and mitigating conflict due to crop-raiding, we advocate an integrative approach taking into account both the IRs and the interactions among macaques, crops and farmers but also the relations among the farmers themselves and the local authorities.",

	abstract = "Human-wildlife conflict is detrimental to the conservation of threatened carnivores and the livelihoods of rural communities. This paper compares perceived levels of human-carnivore conflict experienced on five Namibian communal conservancies and four resettled farming areas. Factors explored include how reported depredation was affected by livestock husbandry practices, the perceived annual cost of depredation and the reported problem predator species. Of the 147 respondents interviewed, perceived depredation was greater than in previous studies; high perceived depredation was associated with greater rates of predator removal, increased ranking of predators as problems and increased predator sighting frequency. Small stock species were the most commonly depredated livestock. The most frequently perceived predators were: jackals on goats and sheep, wild cats on chickens, leopards on horses and spotted hyenas on cattle. The financial cost of this predation was US$508898, mostly attributable to cattle depredation, and agricultural training schemes recommending good livestock management may help reduce this cost. A move from small to large stock farming could be promoted in areas with an abundance of small- to medium-sized carnivores and a lack of large carnivores. Further incentives, such as meat provision and income from consumptive and non-consumptive tourism could ensure benefits outweigh costs of wildlife coexistence. Namibia has been commended for its efforts to conserve large tracts of land, and the wildlife within them, through the formation of conservancies (Weaver & Skyer 2003). Conservancies are legally defined protected areas, comanaged by neighbouring land occupiers, which aim to collaboratively use natural resources in a sustainable manner (CANAM [Conservancy Association of Namibia] 2010). There are two types of conservancies: communal and commercial; the former are created by pastoral land occupiers where the land title is retained by the government with certain restrictions and governance is devolved upon traditional authorities, whereas the latter are created by land owners who intensively and extensively farm livestock and game on a commercial level. Resettlement farms are part of the National Resettlement Policy, where productive commercial farmland is being redistributed to previously disadvantaged Namibians. Commercial farmers tend to be wealthier and more able to withstand economic perturbations caused by livestock depredation when compared with communal farmers; human-wildlife conflict can thus be more frequent and devastating in communal areas (Frank 1998; Butler 2000; Schiess-Meier et al. 2007). Support for carnivore conservation in communal areas also appears to be lower than that on commercial land (Selebatso et al. 2008), which may lead to increased elimination of carnivores in communal landscapes. $",

@article{Shelton_2004,
	abstract = "Predation (a mode of life in which food is primarily obtained by killing and consuming other animals) is a purely natural phenomenon, but it is a problem when the predator becomes too abundant or it is unacceptable for humans to share individuals of particular species of prey. Predation has likely been a problem since domestication and continues to be a problem which must be dealt with today. Although much of the focus in this compilation of papers is the live- stock industry, predation may also be of concern with respect to wildlife species or household pets. The larger predator species may also constitute a direct threat to man. Some predator species (especially wild or feral swine and coy- otes) may also interfere with other agricultural endeavors through destruction of fences, damaging crops, or the threat of spread of disease (Sewart et al., - this issue). Predation management with one goal in mind (i.e., protection of sheep) may also have spin-off benefits for other species as well (Shwiff and Merrell, Allen and Fleming, Shwiff and Bodenchuk, this issue). It is generally recognized that in commercial production of ruminants for meat and fiber production, confinement rearing is not an option. It is reasonably estab- lished that in monetary terms, the greatest total loss due to predation is that suffered by the beef cattle industry (Huben, Bruscino and Cleveland; Howery and DeLiberto, this issue) due to their greater value, larger numbers and wider distribution. With adult sheep, losses range from 1.4 to 8.4 percent and lamb losses range from 6.3 to 29.3 percent. In a similar study conducted with Angora goats in South Texas, Guthrey and Beasom (1978) reported 49\% losses of adult does and 64\% losses of kid goats due to predators (primarily coyotes). These studies likely represent the most accurate data available, but these reports are specific to the conditions under which the data were collected. The absence of control on study sites likely represents no control on the specific property involved but not necessarily on neighboring properties. The possibility of predator drift from these adjoining areas suggests that the reported loss estimates are likely conservative (Shwiff and Bodenchuk, this issue). Some Conclusions and Recommendations: 1. Predation is a more serious problem for the livestock industry than most people realize unless they are somehow involved. This problem is almost certain to increase due to the dispersal of feral or wild hogs throughout the country and the expanding range of the reintroduced grey wolf. 2. Because predator species do not respect property or political boundaries, it is important that control efforts be conducted on a national, state or regional basis. At present, these efforts are carried out by the USDA-APHIS Wildlife Service Programs in cooperation with state agencies and livestock producers. Possibly some type of zoning could permit adapting management methods to the unique area being served. An appropriate approach for free ranging (fenced pastures) in the Southwest may be quite different from herded flocks or for farm flocks dispersed throughout the country. 3. Research relating to predation management should be a continuing effort, but should be a multidisciplinary effort involving those knowledgeable and close to the industries being served. Further, more research is needed to make existing management methods more effective, efficient and economical. 4. There is a need for more effective predator management tools including the limited use of effective and environmentally safe toxicants (see Fagerstone et al., this issue).",

It is desirable but not necessary to achieve economic efficiency in predation management programs.??? In order to achieve efficiency the benefits of a program must exceed the costs, which requires the accurate measurement of benefits and costs. In this paper we identified, direct, spillover and intangible benefits in relation to the protection of livestock from predation. This will provide a template for the quantification of these benefits, which will lead to a more accurate evaluation of predation management programs. Direct benefits usually can be calculated, and in most benefits-cost analyses of predation management these are the only benefits that are reported. Spillover benefits are more difficult to quantify, however, they reflect the indirect benefits of a particular program. Intangible benefits are almost impossible to quantify but recognition of their importance in a predation management program is vital to provide an accurate description of the contribution of a predation management program. Unless economic assessments of livestock predation management programs include all of these benefits, programs are significantly understating the value of livestock predation management. Spill-over: 1. Increase in game species when controlling predators of livestock (and vice versa). 2. Economic benefit to wider community dependent on farming (e.g. job creation). Intangible: 1. Increased cooperation between land-owners. 2. Less ineffective and illegal control methods. 3. Less environmetally damaging control methods. 4. Less stress for livestock owners.",

Long-term records of individual lions permitted the categorization of stock-raiding lions as habitual 'problem animals' or 'occasional stock raiders'. Management strategies for each group under varying conditions are presented, with optimal solutions emerging as translocation for occasional stock raiders and elimination for problem animals. Success of the strategies depends on long-term monitoring of individual lions and co-operation between farmers and conservation authorities. The results strongly suggest that problems with stock-raiding lions can often be alleviated without killing the lions, if the history of the individuals is known.

	abstract = {What is this thing called community-based natural resource management that has become a catch phrase in conservation circles in Namibia? This paper attempts to address this question and identifies several problems with the frequent use of the term. \"Community-based natural resource management\" is normally accompanied by an additional term {\ss}ustainable utilisation\". There are a number of fundamental ecological steps that need to be followed if \"community-based natural resource management\" and {\ss}ustainable utilisation\" are to succeed. The resource has to be identified, counted and it's distribution determined. Often counting techniques must be designed and the counts have to be reliable with an acceptable level of precision. Counting techniques then have to be modified into a reliable and repeatable monitoring programme. Thereafter the certain relevant ecological dynamics of the resource need to be determined: these may include the rate of increase, fecundity and mortality rates, dispersal and dispersion. Then the potential functional and numerical response of the resource to the consumer needs to be looked at. Here different types of utilisation are assessed, maximum sustainable yields are calculated and what the utilisation does to the resource mentioned. None of these points appeared to receive much attention by the parties involved in Namibia. The biggest flaw, however, appears to lie with "Community-based" side of the natural resource management. In conclusion, natural resource management is complicated even if it is community-based. There are clear and fundamental guidelines to the science of natural resource management and many of these guidelines must also relate work with local communities. The project in the Nyae Nyae region, and probably all other similar projects in Namibia, do not appear to consider these fundamentals and therefore cannot succeed in the long term.},

	abstract = "Tourism can play an important role in the protection and conservation of wildlife and the natural environment. The simultaneous growth of wildlife populations, tourism, and community-based conservation during the past five years in the Kunene Region (northwest) of Namibia is testimony to this. Under the current climate where local people benefit from wildlife, primarily through tourism, and communal conservancies enter into agreements with tour operators, the tourism industry{\rq}s potential role in wildlife conservation is ever increasing. Along with black rhinos and elephants, lions are one of the most popular species among tourists. The value of lions and the benefits through tourism in the Kunene Region, must arguably out-way the losses incurred when lions kill livestock Notwithstanding, people still pose the biggest threat to lions. Local communities suffer financial losses when lions prey on their livestock, upon which they often retaliate (legally) by killing lions. The tourism industry and related entities (including communal conservancies) enjoy the benefits, but the local people that live close to lions (i.e. individual farmers) suffer all the losses. This discrepancy has previously been identified and there is a need for preferential benefits to those local people. IRDNC agreed to provide funding and logistical support to establish a self-insurance scheme with the Purros Conservancy, as part of their HACSIS programme. Under the scheme all registered members of the Purros Conservancy are eligible to claim for livestock losses to lions. Eligible claims are, however, subject to certain conditions. For example, claims for livestock killed in wildlife zones or at night would not be valid, and livestock losses must be reported within three days. The Conservancy Committee will manage the scheme, verify claims by investigating all cases, and make payments according to agreed market-related prices for each livestock species. The success of lion eco-tourism depends on a) a sound knowledge of the behaviour \& ecology of the lions acquired through applied research, b) a well developed and tested eco-tourism package that is based on cost-effective, practical and reliable techniques, and c) extensive involvement and training of the Purros Conservancy, where they will retain ownership, along with the tour operators, over the tourism activities and derive direct benefits from lions.",

	abstract = "1. Carnivores are diﬃcult to conserve because of direct and indirect competition with people. Public hunts are increasingly proposed to support carnivore conservation. This article reviews scienti��fic evidence for the e�ffectiveness of public hunts of large carnivores in attaining three common policy goals: stable carnivore populations, preventing con��flict with carnivores (property damage and competition over game) and building public support for carnivore conservation. 2. Sustainable exploitation of stable wildlife populations has a solid, scienti��fic foundation but the theory and its predictions must be adapted to complex patterns of carnivore behavioural ecology and population dynamics that demand years of landscape-level monitoring to understand fully. 3. A review of the evidence that hunting prevents property damage or reduces competition for game reveals large gaps in our understanding. Reducing the number of large carnivores to protect hunters{\rq} quarry species seems straightforward but we still know little about behavioural and ecological responses of the contested prey and sympatric meso-predators. For reducing property damage, the direct e�ffect -- numerical reduction in problematic individual carnivores -- presents numerous obstacles, whereas the indirect e�ffect -- behavioural avoidance of humans by hunted carnivores -- holds more promise. 4. Scienti��fic measures of public support for carnivore-hunting policies are almost completely lacking, particularly measures of attitudes among hunters before and after controversial wildlife is designated as legal game species. Moreover, illegal killing of carnivores does not appear to diminish if they are designated as game. 5. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable hunting to maintain stable populations is well understood in theory but complex life histories of carnivores, and behavioural changes of hunters and the carnivores they stalk may result in unsustainable mortality for carnivores. The direct impact of hunting on carnivore damage to property is unclear and even doubtful given the inability or unwillingness of hunters to remove speci��fic individuals selectively. However, hunters may indirectly deter carnivores from people and their property. The assumption that hunters will steward carnivores simply because they have in the past helped conserve other game species requires more study as preliminary results suggest it is incorrect. Policy-makers may achieve support for policy if they mesh utilitarian and preservationist values held by the general public. A number of opposed hypotheses should be disentangled before researchers con��fidently inform policy on sustainable hunting to prevent con��flicts and build public support for carnivore conservation.",

	abstract = "Globally, many large carnivore species are in decline. The primary threat to these species is the uncontrolled growth in human population numbers. In Africa 60\% of farming activities barely sustains the proprietor and his family, resulting in continuous encroachment into the habitat of natural prey species of predators. Natural prey species are being squeezed out of their natural habitat and, with them, the predators. Too often, however, the predators remain, turning to livestock for survival. The lion Panthera leo is no exception, and retaliation by livestock owners has resulted in lion numbers plummeting significantly and at an alarming rate over the past thirty years. This situation is extremely complicated. The loss of livestock has a far greater economic impact on pastoralists than what the uninformed might imagine. Also, traditionally, the possession of livestock reflects the owner's wealth and his standing in the community. This adds a twist to an already sensitive situation. This paper discusses the impact of pastoral farming and wildlife management practices on lion/livestock interactions in the Kgalagadi-south region of Botswana, highlighting specific concerns and recommendations for the conservation ofthis dwindling, damage-causing predator. In the Kgalagadi-South, and unlike in the other regions, depredation accounted for the majority of annual livestock losses, causing twice as many losses as disease and 28\% more than drought. Most of the respondents approved of trophy hunting of problem predators. 76\% of the respondents indicated that they will tolerate an increase in the density of lions should such hunting be allowed. Where the Kgalagadi-south region's population, together with tourism, has grown noticeably over the six-year period since the 1999/2000 survey (see Funston, 2001), no data is currently available on either the number of stock or lion losses in this area, nor of the effect that the blanket hunting ban is having on lion numbers in this area. Instead, all the information that is available emphasises the seriousness of the current situation in the Kgalagadi-south, the potential detrimental impact on lion conservation and the urgency to find solutions. From the 1999/2000 survey (Funston, 2001) it seems that livestock owners in general are inclined to cooperate if workable solutions to livestock depredation are offered. The success of Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) in Botswana prior to the hunting ban is further evidence of the opportunities that can be explored. Local population growth, poverty and the probable proportional increase of livestock numbers (and accompanying degradation of grazing veld) may offer the greatest challenge in the process in finding a workable and practicable solution to both lion conservation and future prosperity to the community. Most importantly, comprehensive interdisciplinary research in the study area is needed to assist in developing appropriate conflict management strategies. Results of studies done elsewhere, e.g. by Kolowski and Holekamp (2006) [who, along a Kenyan reserve border, found that monthly depredation frequency was not linked to improved fences, more watchdogs and high levels of human activity, but correlated negatively with natural prey abundance] may be valuable for incorporation in different areas. However, research results in one area do not necessarily apply to other areas. An area-specific survey with the emphasis on eventual solutions to lionllivestock clashes has become crucial for the Kgalagadi-south region.",

	abstract = "Public damage abatement and compensation programs may be used to alter private incentives for damage abatement and habitat provision. A model is developed that explains the economic logic behind prevalent characteristics of public wildlife damage programs. The model is supported with an examination of a broad cross-section of wildlife agency policy and law. The model can be used by wildlife managers and policy makers as a conceptual framework for understanding the incentive effects of compensation and abatement policy. The hypothesis that persistent institutions act as if to maximize wealth of public or common property resources subject to informational constraints and contracting costs has been argued widely (Alchian 1950, Stigler 1992), and in the context of wildlife law and regulatory structure more specifically (Lueck 1991, Lueck and Yoder 1997). This analysis provides a model and broad evidence to suggest that wildlife damage institutions are generally consistent with a theory of constrained wealth maximization over wildlife resources. To the extent that maximization of the net value of wildlife resources for all interested parties is an explicit objective of wildlife managers, it provides a conceptual framework for designing wildlife damage and compensation programs to satisfy this objective. The model suggests that damage abatement and hunting policy should be designed in an attempt to consider the resource costs of wildlife populations and the benefits of wildlife populations, as well as the relative costs and effectiveness of implementing alternative policy structures.",

This is achieved through integrated, multi-disciplinary environmental assessment, in which the drivers of decline, both climatic and socio-economic are identified. The primary research is predominantly archival making use of historical documentary sources. The study includes two parts: a full reconstruction of the climate of the Namaqualand area using historical documentary sources and a detailed socio-economic history. To achieve the climatic reconstruction a proxy precipitation data set is compiled for the Namaqualand area using historical documentary sources. This data set is graphically represented and the notable periods of severe drought identified include: 1805; 1807; 1812; 1817; 1820-1821; 1825-1827; 1834-1836; 1844-1845; 1855-1857, 1860-1862; 1865-1868; 1874- 1875; 1880-1883; 1893-1896. The documentary derived data set is tested for accuracy against available rainfall data for the period spanning 1878-1900 and overall a close correlation is revealed. In addition, widespread droughts were identified using other similar studies and possible co-incidence with El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation low phase events is postulated. Drought frequency and intensity is revealed to have been similar throughout the 19th century however, the ability of the Leliefontein Namaqua population to cope with these droughts declines sharply. The reasons for this emerge though the second part of the research, the historical livelihoods and vulnerability study. The community experience decline from sustainable livelihoods at the beginning of the 19th century to poverty and famine by the end of the period. This deterioration is not constant and the period spanning 1816-1853 shows relative improvement due to nomadic pastoral livelihoods and the addition of seasonal agriculture. However, increased diversity of livelihoods and increased exposure to external economic factors result in rapid decline in the second half of the century. Exploitative cattle trade, encroachment and settlement by the colonial population, the introduction of agriculture, copper mining and the introduction of wage labour, the growth of a cash based economy and the restriction of land availability for transhumance lead to a dramatic decrease in community resilience in the second half of the century, resulting in each successive drought having worse effects. Finally, the role of the written word in representing the Namaqua population is interrogated. The function of Colonial scripting in justifying exploitative policy making and legitimating the expropriation of land and the extraction of labour is interrogated. This integrated study reveals the importance of including both human and anthropogenic factors in environmental historigraphy. Socio-economic changes and disempowerment drive the decline in Namaqualand, but climatic factors severely compound this and hasten the decline.",

Using contemporary examples from diverse scienti��fic disciplines, this paper explores differences in practice between historical and experimental research vis-a-vis the testing of hypotheses. It rejects the claim that historical research is epistemically inferior. For as I argue, scientists engage in two very different patterns of evidential reasoning and, although there is overlap, one pattern predominates in historical research and the other pattern predominates in classical experimental research (they are trying to eliminate false positives and false negatives).

However, we still do not have a clear picture of the spatial patterns of felid abundance in Southeast Asia, particularly with respect to the large areas of highly-disturbed habitat. An important obstacle to increasing the usefulness of camera trap data is the widespread practice of setting cameras at non-random locations. Non-random deployment interacts with non-random space-use by animals, causing biases in our inferences about relative abundance from detection frequencies alone. This may be a particular problem if surveys do not adequately sample the full range of habitat features present in a study region. Using camera-trapping records and incidental sightings from the Kalabakan Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, we aimed to assess the relative abundance of felid species in highly-disturbed forest, as well as investigate felid space-use and the potential for biases resulting from non-random sampling. Although the area has been intensively logged over three decades, it was found to still retain the full complement of Bornean felids, including the bay cat Pardofelis badia, a poorly known Bornean endemic. Camera-trapping using strictly random locations detected four of the five Bornean felid species and revealed inter- and intra-specific differences in space-use. We compare our results with an extensive dataset of .1,200 felid records from previous camera-trapping studies and show that the relative abundance of the bay cat, in particular, may have previously been underestimated due to the use of non-random survey locations. Further surveys for this species using random locations will be crucial in determining its conservation status. We advocate the more wide-spread use of random survey locations in future camera-trapping surveys in order to increase the robustness and generality of inferences that can be made.",

The model provides a factor that linearly scales trapping rate with density, depending on two key biological variables (average animal group size and day range) and two characteristics of the camera sensor (distance and angle within which it detects animals). 3. We tested the approach in an enclosed animal park with known abundances of four species, obtaining accurate estimates in three out of four cases. Inaccuracy in the fourth species was because of biased placement of cameras with respect to the distribution of this species. 4. Synthesis and applications.

In this study we present predictions of bite forces for 151 species of extant carnivores, comprising representatives from all eight families and the entire size and ecological spectrum within the order. We show that, when normalized for body size, bite forces differ significantly between the various feeding categories. At opposing extremes and independent of genealogy, consumers of tough fibrous plant material and carnivores preying on large prey both have high bite forces for their size, while bite force adjusted for body mass is low among specialized insectivores. Omnivores and carnivores preying on small prey have more moderate bite forces for their size. These findings indicate that differences in bite force represent important adaptations to and indicators of differing feeding ecologies throughout carnivoran evolution.

Food competition appears to be a plausible explanation. Hyraxes Procavia capensis form ~35\% of leopard diet in the Cederberg (Martins 2010). Verreaux{\rq}s Eagles also to a great extent rely heavily on this prey source (pers. obs.). Therefore it is possible that the eagles are acting to defend their hunting territory in the same way that they would if another eagle intruded. In addition I propose one additional feasible explanation; self-defence. On occasion, Verreaux{\rq}s Eagles can kill a hyrax which may be equal or greater than their own body weight. This forces them to begin eating on the ground (pers. obs.) were they may be at risk of predation or lose their prey by piracy -- particularly from an undetected leopard. Therefore it is beneficial to their safety to attempt to "remove" a leopard from their territory and it is also worth paying the price of probably causing all potential prey to temporarily hide and become unavailable as it is not possible for the eagles to hunt safely in the same area as a leopard. Rowe{\rq}s (1947) account of the injured eagle may also support this suggestion.},

The database was provided by records of found carcasses ascribed to kills by lions assembled over 70 years, coupled with counts of changing prey abundance extending over 30 years. Wildebeest and zebra constituted the most favored prey species during the early portion of the study period, while selection for buffalo rose in the south of the park after a severe drought increased their vulnerability. Rainfall had a negative influence on the proportional representation of buffalo in lion kills, but wildebeest and zebra appeared less susceptible to being killed under conditions of low rainfall. Selection by lions for alternative prey species, including giraffe, kudu, waterbuck, and warthog, was influenced by the changing relative abundance and vulnerability of the three principal prey species. Simultaneous declines in the abundance of rarer antelope species were associated with a sharp increase in selection for these species at a time when all three principal prey species were less available. Hence shifting prey selection by lions affected the dynamics of herbivore populations in different ways: promoting contrasting responses by principal prey species to rainfall variation, while apparently being the main cause of sharp declines by alternative prey species under certain conditions. Accordingly, adaptive responses by predators, to both the changing relative abundance of the principal prey species, and other conditions affecting the relative vulnerability of various species, should be taken into account to understand the interactive dynamics of multispecies predator--prey webs.",

	abstract = "The long-standing view in ecology is that disparity in overall resource selection is the basis for identifying niche breadth patterns, with species having narrow selection being classified {\lq}{\lq}specialists{\rq}{\rq} and those with broader selection being {\lq}{\lq}generalists{\rq}{\rq}. The standard model of niche breadth characterizes generalists and specialists as having comparable levels of overall total resource exploitation, with specialists exploiting resources at a higher level of performance over a narrower range of conditions. This view has gone largely unchallenged. An alternate model predicts total resource use being lower for the specialized species with both peaking at a comparable level of performance over a particular resource gradient. To reconcile the niche breadth paradigm we contrasted both models by developing range-wide species distribution models for Canada lynx, Lynx canadensis, and bobcat, Lynx rufus. Using a suite of environmental factors to define each species{\rq} niche, we determined that Canada lynx demonstrated higher total performance over a restricted set of variables, specifically those related to snow and altitude, while bobcat had higher total performance across most variables. Unlike predictions generated by the standard model, bobcat level of exploitation was not compromised by the trade-off with peak performance, and Canada lynx were not restricted to exploiting a narrower range of conditions. Instead, the emergent pattern was that specialist species have a higher total resource utilization and peak performance value within a smaller number of resources or environmental axes than generalists. Our results also indicate that relative differences in niche breadth are strongly dependent on the variable under consideration, implying that the appropriate model describing niche breadth dynamics between specialists and generalists may be more complex than either the traditional heuristic or our modified version. Our results demonstrate a need to re-evaluate traditional, but largely untested, assumptions regarding resource utilization in species with broad and narrow niches.",

The validity of these presumed correlations between form and function was explored in a field study of feeding behavior in four sympatric species of free-ranging African carnivores; African lion (Panthera leo), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), and wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Based on videotapes of feeding behavior on carcasses of ungulates, the associations among use of teeth, motion of jaw, action of neck, use of paws, and type of food were compiled. There were significant interactions between use of teeth and type of food, and use of teeth and action of neck, in all species. Skin tended to be cut with the carnassials in association with a slight pull, whereas muscle was more likely to be pulled from the carcass by the incisors. Bones usually were cracked with the premolars in hyenas and the postcarnassial molars in wild dogs. Repeated chewing motions were most common in all species when eating the toughest foods, i.e., skin or muscle in combination with bone. The association between use of teeth and type of food was not perfect; sometimes skin was cut with incisors and bones were cracked with carnassials. This apparent lack of precision in use of teeth suggests that selection will likely favor specializations for particular functions in teeth other than those that are the primary tools for that purpose.",

	abstract = "An essential foundation of any science is a standard lexicon. Any given conservation project can be described in terms of the biodiversity targets, direct threats, contributing factors at the project site, and the conservation actions that the project team is employing to change the situation. These common elements can be linked in a causal chain, which represents a theory of change about how the conservation actions are intended to bring about desired project outcomes. If project teams want to describe and share their work and learn from one another, they need a standard and precise lexicon to specifically describe each node along this chain. To date, there have been several independent efforts to develop standard classifications for the direct threats that affect biodiversity and the conservation actions required to counteract these threats. Recognizing that it is far more effective to have only one accepted global scheme, we merged these separate efforts into unified classifications of threats and actions, which we present here. Each classification is a hierarchical listing of terms and associated definitions. The classifications are comprehensive and exclusive at the upper levels of the hierarchy, expandable at the lower levels, and simple, consistent, and scalable at all levels. We tested these classifications by applying them post hoc to 1191 threatened bird species and 737 conservation projects. Almost all threats and actions could be assigned to the new classification systems, save for some cases lacking detailed information. Furthermore, the new classification systems provided an improved way of analyzing and comparing information across projects when compared with earlier systems. We believe that widespread adoption of these classifications will help practitioners more systematically identify threats and appropriate actions, managers to more efficiently set priorities and allocate resources, and most important, facilitate cross-project learning and the development of a systematic science of conservation.

@techreport{ONeill_2007,
	abstract = "Conservation Practice and Alignment with the Standards: Key Findings. Although using somewhat different approaches, CMP member organizations generally audited projects against the major elements outlined by the Open Standards and found that although more than 75\% of projects had rigorously conceptualized and planned their strategies, and that these were being implemented through a suite of actions, less than one-third of projects audited had formal, rigorous systems for monitoring and evaluating effectiveness and impact nor processes for using this information to adapt their strategies and actions accordingly (Figure 2). Projects generally did not maintain documentation detailing successes and failures, findings regarding effectiveness and impact, and key decisions, but often had produced externally oriented documentation focused on education, outreach, and fundraising (with particular emphasis on publicizing achievements). Consequently, although conservation projects and organizations may feel confident that their actions are leading to the mitigation of threats and the improvement in status of conservation targets, it appears that it is rare that projects have the data necessary to credibly demonstrate their impact, to support and justify decision making with regard to the use of resources available for conservation action, or to follow a scientific process of hypothesis testing, learning, adaptation, and professional exchange. The Process of Conservation Auditing: Key Findings. Overall, responses to audit processes have been positive. Audit tools and approaches employed to date have resulted in useful assessments of a wide range of project types, from sites to broad regions, geographically-focused to theme- or issue-focused, new to more mature, etc. Auditing organizations have become skilled at planning and implementing audits, in particular. Select areas for refinement include: Engaging audit and project team members early in audit planning and ensuring that they are well oriented to the audit process; Promoting greater participation in the audit team by external parties and appropriate technical experts; Tailoring the time allotted to the complexity of the project; Effectively engaging those partner organizations who are most relevant; and Using flexible audit frameworks that can be adapted to project context and information needs of project teams and management. To realize fully the benefits and impacts of auditing, follow-up processes could be strengthened considerably by: Identifying a group of individuals who will be responsible for audit follow-up; Developing a post-audit action plan with realistic objectives and timelines; Increasing senior management involvement; Providing access to resources needed to support adoption of audit recommendations; Monitoring progress on the post-audit action plan and communicating results to relevant stakeholders; and Consolidating audit results in a manner that supports broader learning. Costs and Benefits of Conservation Auditing. Although a rigorous financial analysis has not been done and the actual impacts of audits on biodiversity conservation cannot be known (as few projects have systems in place to monitor their impact over time), it can be concluded that the benefits of conservation auditing generally outweigh the costs: Audit findings are commonly thought to be accurate, generally actionable, useful and acted upon about half of the time, and, when acted upon, are believed to increase project effectiveness; Audits build the capacity of staff and promote technical exchange among colleagues; The full potential benefits of auditing are not yet being realized, as CMP members have yet to perform a sufficient number of audits to truly support cross-project and cross-organization learning; and As audit follow-up processes improve, associated impacts are likely to increase significantly. In contrast, costs of auditing are minimal, consisting primarily of travel costs, costs for maintaining audit programs, and of staff time (which can be considered as salary or the opportunity cost of being away from primary responsibilities). Overall, conservation auditing absorbs only a tiny fraction of the overall budget of the large conservation organizations and is normally one of only a few initiatives that strive toward greater credibility in the reporting of the effectiveness and impact of conservation actions. Implications of Findings. The adoption of standards for good project design and management is one means by which conservationists are likely to improve efficiency and strengthen impact by ensuring that an eye is always kept on defining, assessing, and improving progress toward measurable objectives. Conservation auditing supports the adoption of such standards by raising awareness of their existence and providing targeted feedback to conservation projects to better apply the standards and thereby improve their work. In addition, if the conservation projects audited to date are at all representative of the conservation community as a whole, it can also be hoped that auditing will catalyze greater investment in the adoption of standards of good practice by bringing to light the fact that the majority of conservation projects do not have systems in place to monitor progress and impact, evaluate resulting data, and adapt strategies and activities accordingly. Thus, despite what we'd like to believe, it is quite possible that most conservation projects -- and therefore most conservation organizations -- cannot credibly assess their effectiveness and impact, and seldom follow an iterative process to learn from and share successes and failures. Although auditing is clearly one key tool for effecting change, it alone will be insufficient to bring about the necessary shift in the current conservation business culture. For one, the auditing process itself can be improved, particularly by strengthening investment in post-audit actions and by developing more unified tools and methods for conducting audits so that cross-project and cross-organization learning can be consolidated. Beyond auditing, promoting greater adoption of standards of good management practice -- and thereby increasing the credibility of reported results -- will require addressing several key underlying issues, such as inconsistent leadership and direction regarding adaptive management practice within conservation organizations and by the donor community; a lack of consolidated evidence demonstrating that adoption of the standards is broadly feasible; and a lack of real examples and practical guidance. To some degree, the conservation community is working to address these issues, at least in part, by carrying out various types of evaluations to assess strategy, effectiveness, and impact; establishing organization-wide initiatives for biodiversity and activity monitoring; and investing in the development of tools, guidelines, trainings, resource kits and staff. However, for these efforts to be truly useful and ultimately improve accountability, credibility, and the design and management of our work, conservationists, and the donors supporting them, must commit to learning whether we are doing the right things, whether the things we are doing are succeeding or failing, and whether we are having the desired impact.",

Managers of natural areas must achieve a balance between taking conservation action, evaluating the effectiveness of actions taken, and monitoring the general status of biodiversity conserva- tion targets and the threats they face.

Many conservation projects have only a limited monitoring component while other projects have an inexplicably high investment in a single type of monitoring. We offer a conceptual framework to help guide conservation practitioners towards a logical allocation of resources between taking action and different types of monitoring depending on the situation that they are facing. The framework consists of a decision tree that includes an explicit evaluation of three questions: (1) Are there substantial threats facing the conservation entities?; (2) Are there clear and feasible actions known to be effective at abating identi��fied threats?; and (3) Does the project team have high con��fidence in their understanding of the overall conservation situation?

As a result, they are widely used, especially for inventory and production forecasts, for operational planning for up to two years ahead, and for long-term forecasts in some situations, such as population forecasting. This paper provides principles for selecting and preparing data, making seasonal adjustments, extrapolating, assessing uncertainty, and identifying when to use extrapolation. The principles are based on received wisdom (i.e., experts{\rq} commonly held opinions) and on empirical studies. Some of the more important principles are: • In selecting and preparing data, use all relevant data and adjust the data for important events that occurred in the past. • Make seasonal adjustments only when seasonal effects are expected and only if there is good evidence by which to measure them. • In extrapolating, use simple functional forms. Weight the most recent data heavily if there are small measurement errors, stable series, and short forecast horizons. Domain knowledge and forecasting expertise can help to select effective extrapolation procedures. When there is uncertainty, be conservative in forecasting trends. Update extrapolation models as new data are received. • To assess uncertainty, make empirical estimates to establish prediction intervals. • Use pure extrapolation when many forecasts are required, little is known about the situation, the situation is stable, and expert forecasts might be biased.

We developed a rule base to make annual extrapolation forecasts for economic and demographic time series. The development of the rule base drew upon protocol analyses of five experts on forecasting methods. This rule base, consisting of 99 rules, combined forecasts from four extrapolation methods (the random walk, regression, Brown's linear exponential smoothing, and Holt's exponential smoothing) according to rules using 18 features of time series. For one-year ahead ex ante forecasts of 90 annual series, the median absolute percentage error (MdAPE) for rule-based forecasting was 13\% less than that from equally-weighted combined forecasts.

In this paper, we argue that this evaluation ignores other important criteria. Also, their conclusions were illustrated by a simulation study whose relationship to real data was not obvious. Thirdly, prior empirical studies show that the mean square error is an inappropriate measure to serve as a basis for comparison. This undermines the claims made for the GFESM. The available empirical evidence seems clear. Neither the MSE not the GFESM have a place in comparing the relative accuracy of forecasting methods across data sets. The issue had been addressed previously with the conclusion that relative error measures should be used. Empirical research has supported that position.

These beliefs form the foundation of the "educational initiation that prepares and licenses the student for professional practice". The nature of the "rigorous and rigid" preparation helps ensure that the received beliefs are firmly fixed in the student's mind. Scientists take great pains to defend the assumption that scientists know what the world is like...To this end, "normal science" will often suppress novelties which undermine its foundations. Research is therefore not about discovering the unknown, but rather "a strenuous and devoted attempt to force nature into the conceptual boxes supplied by professional education". A shift in professional commitments to shared assumptions takes place when an anomaly undermines the basic tenets of the current scientific practice These shifts are what Kuhn describes as scientific revolutions - "the tradition-shattering complements to the tradition-bound activity of normal science" New assumptions --"paradigms" - require the reconstruction of prior assumptions and the re-evaluation of prior facts.

	abstract = "(1) A southern Spanish passerine bird community was studied throughout a year, collecting information on species composition and abundance, as well as foraging behaviour and feeding site utilization of component species. In this paper, comparisons of behavioural, morphological and feeding site niche characteristics between resident and non-resident species are made. (2) For all species, within-species foraging diversity is significantly greater for non-resident than for resident species, indicating that individual resident species have a narrower repertoireof foraging tactics than non-resident ones. On a seasonal basis, between-species foraging diversity for non-residents is higher than that for residents during spring and early summer, but it falls well below the figures for resident species in winter. (3) Resident species are morphologically more diversifiedand less densely packed in the morphological space than non-resident ones. Resident species tend to show a wider range of bill length, and to be long-billed, with respect to non-residents. (4) Resident species exhibited feeding site niche shifts in response to its own population density, higher densities promoting wider niches as theoretically expected. Non-residents did not show comparable shifts, although some degree of response to density was noted. (5) A canonical correlation analysis was able to show that resident and non-resident species adjust themselves to the changing environment in different ways. Whereas residents do it by means of changes in density, niche breadth and between-species foraging diversity, non-residents species achieve the same end by means of changes in morphological specialization, behavioural specialization and diversity of foraging tactics, all of which take place through seasonal replacements of species. (6) The seasonal organization of the study community is discussed in relation to other temperate and non-temperate communities. It is proposed that the observed great dominance of residents with respect to number of individuals may be associated with a relatively low degree of seasonality in food supply to birds. The reliability and predominating abundance throughout the annual cycle of the food types exploited by residents, are likely to explain the maintenance of the high behavioural and morphological specialization by individual resident species. The wide spacing on the morphological space among these species may be related to the regular occurrence of periodic phases of food shortage during which this spacing might be vital to survival.",

Although both regard individual differences in behaviour as adaptive in their own right, these two developments appear, at first glance, to be opposing approaches to analysing animal behaviour. Personalities consist of suites of behaviours that are correlated across situations (e.g. some animals are consistently more or less aggressive across situations than other animals) and assumes that animals are limited in their response to their environment. By contrast, the biological market approach considers organisms as traders of commodities (e.g. food or grooming) where the exchange rates of commodities changes with time and is influenced by shifts in the abundance and demand for the commodity, as happens in human markets. Biological markets thus view animal behaviour as extremely plastic whereas the putative existence of animal personalities suggests that animal behaviour may be relatively inflexible. However, the two approaches may be more similar than heretofore realized and may be complementary rather than opposing. Here I briefly review each approach and show how animal personalities can arise from a biological market situation.

	abstract = "The importance of state defence throughout human history warrants inclusion of military operations in discussions of environmental conservation. The sub-discipline warfare ecology was recently proposed (Machlis \& Hanson 2008) to cohere these discussions. Words have the power to clarify, but they also have the power to confuse or polarize public opinion. Inaccurate terms and colloquialisms in the sciences should be identi��fied and replaced with more accurate terms. My objective herein is to discuss how the epithet warfare ecology does little to attract input from important audiences affected by military operations, while an alternative descriptor would engage these audiences. ecology does little to attract input from important audiences affected by military operations, while an alternative descriptor would engage these audiences. Working on ecological issues in relation to military operations can be complex (Anon. 2011). Many stakeholders are biased toward a zero sum viewpoint, whereby bene��fits of militarization are inescapably attached to environmental degradation (Marler et al. 2012). These and other traits of this subdiscipline render it vulnerable to the research- implementation divide that separates academicians from important audiences (Knight et al. 2008; Shackleton et al. 2009). This vulnerability is acute in localities of permanent military installations, where ecologists, conservationists, practitioners, academicians, economists, preservationists and military employees collide with local landowners. Environmental damage during warfare is generally accepted as an unavoidable form of collateral damage. In contrast, the civilian community is not accepting of environmental damage that results from military operations during periods devoid of armed con��flict (Marler \& Moore 2011). Usage of the term warfare ecology consequently leads to confusion, and has the potential to inadvertently disenfranchise the stakeholders who consider warfare irrelevant to their concerns about the military. If ecologists respect the need to bridge the great divide with these audiences, a more accurate epithet for the subdiscipline is required. The illegal entry of a United States (US) Navy vessel through the Tubbataha Marine Park in the Philippines in January 2013 provides a relevant peacetime example. Grounding of the vessel and destruction of reef habitat followed its unauthorized passage through these protected waters. The nascent military buildup on Guam and Tinian islands (Marler \& Moore 2011) illuminates other examples. The local stakeholders do not connect the ongoing environmental degradation to warfare. Some historical examples further reveal the irrelevance of the term warfare ecology. (1) Land condemnations for conversion to military needs were rampant on Guam at times when no armed con��flict was occurring (Marler \& Moore 2011). (2) The brown tree snake Boiga irregularis was introduced to Guam around 1950, and thrust Guam on the international scene as a heavily-cited example of a collapsing ecosystem (Rodda et al. 1992). This invasion was perpetrated by the US military as they redistributed military assets throughout the region. It did not occur during warfare, yet it is one of the most in��fluential turning points in the ecological history of Guam, and the cascading environmental responses continue to date (Mortensen et al. 2008; Rogers et al. 2012). (3) The US military repeatedly distributed Leucaena leucocephala seeds throughout barren habitats in Guam and Tinian from the 1940s to the 1960s. This species is now one of the most troublesome invasive plant species in the Mariana Islands (Marler \& Moore 2011). Similarly, military land management and training activities negatively affect conservation activities in California, Colorado, Washington, Wisconsin, Texas, Manitoba and western Europe (reviewed by Quist et al. 2003). These examples did not occur during actual local warfare, yet collectively they reveal the negative impact that military culture imposes on environmental conservation. They demonstrate the term warfare ecology is too constrictive to adequately cover all aspects of how ecology is in��fluenced by military operations, at least from the viewpoints of the affected permanent civilian residents and local government of��ficials who cope with military culture in their neighbourhoods.",

The RSF provides a response surface of estimated relative probability of use of resource units within an area that can be computed both before and after changes in the unit characteristics. The change in volume under the response surface yields an intuitive index of risk (value) associated with habitat (resource) changes that directly measures a component of the total risk of changes to animals or populations.

Our objective was to relate long-term predation-mortality patterns for adult woodland caribou [Rangifer tarandus caribou (Banfield)] from Alberta, Canada (1991-2002), with patterns of multivariate habitat selection. 3. We first compared probabilities of radio-tracked caribou dying (n = 55) from predation in habitats within the home range, controlling for habitat availability, with that expected from habitat selection probabilities for the same animals during life. We then compared survival rates of caribou (n = 141) possessing dissimilar patterns of habitat selection using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. 4. Patterns in habitat-specific predation mortality differed significantly from expected given probabilities of habitat selection during life (P < 0-0001). Cox regression indicated that mortality rates of caribou due to predation were affected significantly by and can be predicted from patterns of selection (P = 0-02). 5. Our results strongly suggest that uplands (primarily mixed deciduous and coniferous forest) present caribou with higher than expected levels of predation risk, and that caribou can avoid predation by maximizing selection of peatlands (open, conifer-dominated bogs and fens). 6. Approaches presented in this study may be useful for ecologists interested in assessing the influence of mortality factors on broad-scale, multivariate resource selection.

For example, the pangolin in southern Africa (like the echidna in being toothless, armoured and slow in metabolism, movement and growth) is larger than any known Australian myrmecophage, living or extinct. This could be the result either of accidents of history or of different environments on the two continents. Four hypotheses which would support the historical explanation are refuted. There are no phylogenetic constraints on the incidents large mammals in Australia, nor is there evidence that large myrmecophages have recently disappeared from our study areas. Evidence for myrmecophages larger than in surviving forms occurring the past is not greater in Australia than in southern Africa. Fungus-culturing termites (Macrotermitinae) are absent from Australia, but are eaten by the largest myrmecophage, the earth-pig, in southern Africa. Fungus-culturing and grass-eating termites are larger than their nearest counterparts in Australia. In semi-arid sample-sites with grasses and Acacia spp., termites are less abundant in Australia than in southern Africa. Large myrmecophages are associated with large leaf-eating eutherian mammals in southern Africa. We suggest that food consisting of termites and ants is less productive and reliable in Australia than in southern Africa. This may be partly because termites in Australia lack the relatively rich foods that are continually provided to their southern African counterparts by the trampling and dung of grazers and other herbivores and because sporadic but intense fires remove more foliage in Australia than in southern Africa. Our study refutes the role of chance in shaping the Australian fauna, and shows that different ecological conditions affect the biogeography of myrmecophages, and termites and ants eaten by them, on the two continents.

	abstract = "Predation is increasingly pointed out as one of the factors contributing to population declines of ground-nesting farmland birds, though it remains poorly understood how ongoing transformations of agricultural landscapes affect predator assemblages. This study addressed this issue, estimating the contribution of landscape composition and con��figuration to spatial variation in species richness and abundances of mammalian carnivores across a gradient of agricultural intensi��fication in southern Portugal. The carnivore assemblage was diverse (10 species), but it was largely dominated by just three widespread and abundant species of generalist predators: domestic dog (Canis familiaris), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon). The number of domestic carnivore species and the abundance of cats (Felis catus) increased along with farmland occupation by human dwellings, whereas dogs were not responsive to landscape variables. The species richness of wild carnivores was highest in landscapes with a patchwork of arable ��fields and semi-natural habitats such as forests and shrubland, though it was also high in irrigated landscapes with dense networks of irrigation channels and tree lines bordering agricultural ��fields. Irrigation was also positively associated with the abundance of otters (Lutra lutra) and mongooses. Cats, foxes, badgers (Meles meles), and total and wild carnivore abundances, were positively affected by increasing cover by eucalyptus and pine forest plantations. In general, results suggest that the highest diversity and abundance of carnivores in Mediterranean farmland may occur in mosaic landscapes with small agricultural ��fields, high cover by woody vegetation patches and corridors, and many human dwellings. Preventing scrub encroachment and afforestation may thus be necessary to maintain a low predation risk in open farmland habitats, which are often inhabited by ground-nesting birds of high conservation concern. Conversely, keeping shrubland and forest patches within farmed landscapes may be essential where carnivore persistence is a relevant conservation goal.",

To find out what those questions are in the UK, representatives from 28 organizations involved in policy, together with scientists from 10 academic institutions, were asked to generate a list of questions from their organizations. 2. During a 2-day workshop the initial list of 1003 questions generated from consulting at least 654 policy makers and academics was used as a basis for generating a short list of 100 questions of significant policy relevance. Short-listing was decided on the basis of the preferences of the representatives from the policy-led organizations. 3. The areas covered included most major issues of environmental concern in the UK, including agriculture, marine fisheries, climate change, ecosystem function and land management. 4. The most striking outcome was the preference for general questions rather than narrow ones. The reason is that policy is driven by broad issues ratherthan specific ones. In contrast, scientists are frequently best equipped to answer specific questions. This means that it may be necessary to extract the underpinning specific question before researchers can proceed. 5.

Greater communication between policy makers and scientists is required in order to ensure that applied ecologists are dealing with issues in a way that can feed into policy.

	abstract = "Modeling the probability of use of land units characterized by discrete and continuous measures, we present a Bayesian random-effects model to assess resource selection. This model provides simultaneous estimation of both individual- and population-level selection. Deviance information criterion (DIC), a Bayesian alternative to AIC that is sample-size specific, is used for model selection. Aerial radiolocation data from 76 adult female caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and calf pairs during 1 year on an Arctic coastal plain calving ground were used to illustrate models and assess population-level selection of landscape attributes, as well as individual heterogeneity of selection. Landscape attributes included elevation, NDVI (a measure of forage greenness), and land cover-type classification. Results from the first of a 2-stage model-selection procedure indicated that there is substantial heterogeneity among cow-calf pairs with respect to selection of the landscape attributes. In the second stage, selection of models with heterogeneity included indicated that at the population-level, NDVI and land cover class were significant attributes for selection of different landscapes by pairs on the calving ground. Population-level selection coefficients indicate that the pairs generally select landscapes with higher levels of NDVI, but the relationship is quadratic. The highest rate of selection occurs at values of NDVI less than the maximum observed. Results for land cover-class selections coefficients indicate that wet sedge, moist sedge, herbaceous tussock tundra, and shrub tussock tundra are selected at approximately the same rate, while alpine and sparsely vegetated landscapes are selected at a lower rate. Furthermore, the variability in selection by individual caribou for moist sedge and sparsely vegetated landscapes is large relative to the variability in selection of other land cover types. The example analysis illustrates that, while sometimes computationally intense, a Bayesian hierarchical discrete-choice model for resource selection can provide managers with 2 components of population-level inference: average population selection and variability of selection. Both components are necessary to make sound management decisions based on animal selection.",

This multiplicative concept of species diversity contrasts with the lesser known idea that a- and J3-diversities sum to give the total diversity. This additive partitioning species of diversity is nearly as old as the multiplicative concept, yet ecologists are just now beginning to use additive partitioning to examine patterns of species diversity. In this review we discuss why additive partitioning remained "hidden" until just a few years ago. The rediscovery of additive partitioning has expanded the way in which ecologists define and measure J3-diversity. Beta diversity is no longer relegated to describing change only along an environmental gradient. Through additive partitioning, B-diversity is explicitly an average amount of diversity as is a-diversity. We believe that the additive partitioning of diversity onto a and B components will continue to become more widely used because it allows for a direct comparison of a- and B-diversities. It also has particular relevance for testing ecological theory concerned with the determinants of species diversity at multiple spatial scales and potential applications in conservation biology.},

Carnivores feature prominently in these warnings because some species cause serious economic damage and may even prey on humans. This issue is playing an increasingly prominent role in conservation conferences, including the World Parks Congress 2003 in Durban, South Africa. There are at least three reasons for this alarm and attention. First, humans are increasingly entering and developing hitherto remote carnivore habitats. Second, many large-carnivore populations are recovering from past extirpation efforts and becoming involved in mutually threatening interactions with humans. Finally, the response of affected communities undermines urgently needed wildlife conservation action around the world. People who fear for their safety or perceive economic risks from wildlife will not support conservation agendas. They also retaliate against wildlife, killing many nontarget animals in the process. Affected communities oppose protected areas and their managers, leading to political conflicts and interruptions to other conservation activities. Finally, powerful interest groups become involved in these conflicts, including agricultural industries, livestock producers, hunters, and government authorities charged with economic security, human health, and safety. Conservation biologists cannot oppose such forces and still hope to build long-term, cooperative alliances to protect biodiversity.",

The study assessed if castration is a feasible strategy to allow social housing of male surplus individuals in bachelor pairs and mixed-sex groups. Behavioural data were collected during a 7-week study for a total of 173 h in Howletts \& Port Lympne Wild Animal Parks (UK). Males in three bachelor pairs, as well as males in four mixed-sex groups were observed. With the exception of one bachelor pair of intact males, and one-mixed sex group containing only castrated males, the study groups included a single intact male, with the remaining males being castrated. In bachelor pairs, males compensated for a lack of other social partners by an increase in af��filiative male--male interactions. In mixed-sex groups, the presence of females did not lead to an increase in agonistic male--male interactions. However, males gave preference to females over males as social partners. In general, castrated males displayed more submissive, while intact males displayed more dominance behaviours, indicating that castration affects the social status in Javan langurs. The results of the study suggest that castration can be used as a managerial tool to allow surplus males to remain as subordinate follower males in bachelor pairs as well as mixed-sex groups to provide socialisation and companionship.",

Deliberate and long-term provision of food to wildlife has been shown to alter natural behaviour patterns and population levels. It has also resulted in the dependency of animals on the human provided food and their habituation to human contact. Intra- and inter-species aggression has also occurred where wildlife, in their e�fforts to obtain food, have harmed one another and harmed tourists. There are also important health implications arising from arti��ficial food sources where injury and disease have resulted. While the great majority of cases show negative impacts arising from supplemental feeding of wildlife, this is not always the case. Certainly there are psychological, social and economic bene��fits that are experienced on the human side of the interaction and, in a limited number of cases, the wildlife can be shown to have bene��fited as well.

This practice is often promoted as an economic incentive to conserve the focal species, yet has stimulated debate based on the potential for risks to human safety and perceptions of behavioural shifts in provisioned populations. We studied a population of Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) in the Bahamas that has been subject to regular provisioning for >20 years. We used a combination of focal observations of sharks during feeding events, remote acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analysis of shark muscle tissue to determine the impacts of provisioning on the trophic signatures and ranging behaviour of sharks in this population. A small number of large sharks monopolised more than 50\% of the bait on offer. These {\lq}fed{\rq} individuals showed signi��ficant 15N enrichment in their tissues compared to conspeci��fics of the same size that failed to obtain bait at the feeding site, and un-provisioned sharks from a control site. Despite the disparity in trophic signatures, fed, unfed and control sharks exhibited similar degrees of residency at their respective home receiver sites, and travelled similar daily minimum distances. Thus, despite long-term provisioning of this Caribbean reef shark population, there is no evidence for shifts in the behaviours considered which might affect the ecological role of these sharks.

Nowadays, as much as 30--40\% of all food produced in Earth is wasted. We argue here that predictable anthropogenic food subsidies (PAFS) provided historically by humans to animals has shaped many communities and ecosystems as we see them nowadays. PAFS improve individual ��fitness triggering population increases of opportunistic species, which may affect communities, food webs and ecosystems by altering processes such as competition, predator--prey interactions and nutrient transfer between biotopes and ecosystems. We also show that PAFS decrease temporal population variability, increase resilience of opportunistic species and reduce community diversity. Recent environmental policies, such as the regulation of dumps or the ban of ��fishing discards, constitute natural experiments that should improve our understanding of the role of food supply in a range of ecological and evolutionary processes at the ecosystem level.

However, there are clear indications, presented in this paper, of a growing tendency to adopt approaches that emphasize animal welfare and even animal rights. Research limitations/implications -- The growing awareness of animal rights, the changing public opinion and the in��fluence of animal rights{\rq} movements is forcing animal attractions to re-evaluate their attitudes toward the use of animals. Generally, animal attractions should adopt an approach that combines entertainment, education and welfare concerns. Speci��fic guidelines for each component and recommendations are provided.

	abstract = "We present preliminary data on the dietary habits of black-backed jackals Canis mesomelas in a xeric conservation area (Great Fish River Reserve, South Africa) where large predators are absent and therefore the availability of carcasses reduced. Hence, the question arose whether jackals substantially feed on antelopes through direct predation and/or scavenging of carcasses of animals that died from other natural causes. We therefore collected scats (n = 109) during autumn when, in addition to adults, both newborn and older calves or lambs were available to jackals. The diet of jackals from two areas of the reserve that differ in habitat structure and composition revealed a large and comparable food spectrum. The contribution of antelopes to jackal diet -- expressed as relative volume of remains in the scats -- reached 20.7\%, followed by ``other mammals'' (Suidae, Tubulidentata, Primates; 19.8\%), arthropods (17.6\%), rock hyraxes Procavia capensis and springhares Pedetes capensis (12.8\%) and unidentified plant material (10.5\%). Fruits, carnivores, small rodents and reptiles acted as supplementary food sources (18.6\% in total). Further studies covering the yearly cycle and including an assessment of prey availability and an estimation of food biomass ingested by jackals are needed to fully appreciate the importance of antelopes in jackal diet in areas devoid of large predators.",

This then provides valuable information (that may be otherwise hard to collect) regarding the feeding preferences of carnivores and may contribute to a better understanding of the species{\rq} ecology, conservation and management (Kruuk 1972; Skinner 1976; Skinner \& van Aarde 1981; Kruger et al. 1999; Ott et al. 2007; Wegge et al. 2009). Traditionally, manual photographic reference catalogues and dichotomous keys have been used to assist identification based on hair scale pattern, but these are often time-consuming and require trained individuals. In addition, these methods often suffer from the subjectivity introduced by its reliance on an individual{\rq}s interpretation as opposed to a reliance on quantitative mathematical measures (Verma et al. 2002). Some attempts have been made to use computers to facilitate the identification of species from hair scale patterns. The simplest computer implementation is the interactive tool Hair ID (Brunner \& Triggs 2002) which requires the user to select patterns displayed on a computer screen that best match the hair patterns under observation. More complex implementations have been attempted and include using image analysis methods developed for metallographic investigations (Meyer et al. 1997) and methods utilizing artificial neural networks (She et al. 2001). In addition, computer systems like Hair-MAP compare two hair images to produce a classification decision as to whether or not the hairs come from the same specimen (Verma et al. 2002). Based on the similarity between hair cuticle scale patterns and fingerprint ridge patterns we adapted ridge-based fingerprint matching (Ross et al. 2003) using 2D Gabor filters, which produce feature vector representations of a pattern (Lee 1996), for the identification of mammals based on their unique guard hair scale patterns. The system (called HairSnap) provides a quantitative hair classification aid based on the numerical and statistical analysis of hair patterns. The system was implemented as a Java plug-in for ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), since ImageJ provides numerous predefined image manipulation tools to speed development. The system follows the classical stages (sensor, feature extraction, feature selection, classification and evaluation) of a generic classification system (Theodoridis \& Koutroumbas 2003) and a description of the system{\rq}s design and implementation is provided in Moyo et al. (2006).",

	abstract = "1. For terrestrial carnivores, scat analysis is the technique most often used to determine diets. Various methods of interpreting scat-analysis data exist; however, little is known about how the choice of method affects the results. 2. We reviewed 50 scat-analysis papers to assess the range of methods currently used. Furthermore, we used a large data set from cape fox Vulpes chama and black-backed jackal Canis mesomelas scats to compare 11 scat-analysis methods. Techniques tested included ��five biomass calculation methods, four frequency of occurrence methods, one method that -estimated volume in scats, and another that estimated mass of food items in scats. 3. Frequency of occurrence methods were used in 94\% of reviewed papers, and in 50\% of papers they were the sole methods used. However, we conclude that frequency of occurrence has the least ecological signi��ficance and results can be misleading. Although biomass calculations probably provide the best approximation to true diets, only 23\% of reviewed papers used suitable biomass calculation methods when models were available for the study species. 4. Analysis of fox and jackal scats showed that there were signi��ficant differences among methods when calculating percent diet composition and niche breadth. Additionally, dietary overlap between species differed considerably among the methods (range of R0 = 0.29--0.79). We conclude that the choice of method can have a signi��ficant impact on the results of dietary analysis, and can lead to very different conclusions about a species{\rq} ecology. 5. The best approximation of the true diet can be obtained by using a biomass calculation model that was developed for the same species, or for a closely related species with a similar food spectrum. When no such model is available, either the volume or mass of diet components in the scats should be used. To document rare food items, frequency of occurrence data could also be given. biomass calculation, black-backed jackal, cape fox, diet analysis, fre- quency of occurrence",

The ��first application of image pattern recognition techniques to the classi��fication of African mammalian species using hair patterns is presented.

The scale pattern sub-process utilises a 2D Gabor ��filter-bank to extract features from a scale pattern image and these features are classi��fied using a minimum distance measure. The cross section sub-process utilises Hu{\rq}s moments to extract features and a minimum distance measure to classify these features. Implementation of the scale pattern sub-process produces a best result of 64\% accuracy when using a ��filter-bank of size eight and a best result of 76\% when using a ��filter-bank of size sixteen. The implementation of the cross-section sub-process produces a best result of 48\%.

	abstract = "N amibia is thought to host the largest population of free-ranging cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus and the majority of this population inhabits commercial farm- land (Morsbach 1987). Some farmers consider that cheetahs prey on both livestock and wild herbivores that are valuable for trophy hunting, and this perceived offtake has generated con��flict leading to the indiscriminate elimination of cheetahs from some farms (Marker et al. 1996). To help assess the economic cost of cheetahs on commercial farmland, information on the proportion of different prey species in their diet is required. Faecal samples (n = 67) were collected mainly from trees that cheetahs use to scent mark. Samples were stored in glass jars at -20°C until processing, then diluted in warm water for at least 1 hour, and hairs extracted. Intact hairs were air-dried, puri��fied with 96\% ethanol to remove blood remains, rinsed with distilled water and dried again. Hairs were then macroscopically divided into different types according to length, colour, thickness and shape. Imprints were made for 3 hairs of each type of hair. To obtain an imprint of a hair (Fig. 2), the base or tip of the hair was held on a 0.1 x 1 x 2 cm celluloid plate with the ��fingertip and the free end brushed over with a small brush soaked with acetone. The hair thereby sinks into the celluloid plate. After 3 to 5 seconds hairs were removed with a pair of tweezers. Celluloid plates with imprints were ��fixed with Entellan on a slide and examined under the microscope at 200x magni��fication. Hairs were identi��fied to species using a reference catalogue with hairs of belly and back of potential prey animals and carnivores. In contrast to conventional imprinting methods this method is simple and quick. Furthermore, imprints can be preserved for many years without loss of quality.",

However, advances in satellite tracking technology are allowing researchers to locate kill sites by investigating global positioning system (GPS) clusters in both space and time. Here we compare leopard Panthera pardus dietary estimates (composition and biomass) of small, medium and large prey using three techniques: faecal analysis, GPS cluster analysis and GPS cluster analysis supplemented with faecal samples located at cluster sites. We demonstrate that estimates of leopard prey composition and biomass intake from each technique produce comparatively similar results. Nevertheless, the detection of feeding events did increase by 20--23\% when supplementing GPS-located kills with faecal samples. The investigation of GPS clusters offers an equivalent method of leopard dietary estimation to that of faecal analysis. When carried out intensively, the GPS cluster method is capable of detecting leopard predation on prey species within small, medium and large weight categories. Although requiring additional resources, supplementing GPS-located kills with GPS-located faecal samples results in the most detailed dietary estimates by detecting kills missed during GPS cluster investigations.

The success of such re-introductions depends very much on the quality of the information that is available to guide management decisions, but in many cases, little information is available. The re-introduction of lions and cheetahs to Sanbona created the opportunity to monitor the behaviour of re-introduced predators to a relatively large system that was characterised by a low ungulate stocking density and little standing water. The broad aims were to study the feeding and spatial ecologies of the lions and cheetahs, to collect standard base-line data, and to examine the effects of the low prey density and limited standing water on habitat selection, range size and diet. The diet (data collected from direct observation and faecal analysis) was similar to that reported in previous studies, and lions and cheetahs preferred greater kudu, black wildebeest and springbok. Lions preferred medium to large prey items, and cheetahs preferred medium to small prey items. The hilly and mountainous terrain of much of the reserve meant that only 50\% of the total space was available to the predators. Home ranges of most of the predators were focused around the single large body of standing water. This is likely to have been a response to the water, the vegetation, and the prey that was attracted to these. Habitat selection was also influenced by inter and intra-specific interactions at least for a solitary male lion and female cheetahs. Range sizes were larger than on some other reserves and it is suggested that this was a result of the low prey density. These results form the basis for management recommendations including the importance of continuing to monitor the system and opening up additional parts of the reserve to the predators.",

While full genome sequencing of mammals is rapidly progressing, the ability to assemble and align orthologous whole chromosome regions from more than a few species is still not possible. The intense focus on building of comparative maps for companion (dog and cat), laboratory (mice and rat) and agricultural (cattle, pig, and horse) animals has traditionally been used as a means to understand the underlying basis of disease-related or economically important phenotypes. However, these maps also provide an unprecedented opportunity to use multispecies analysis as a tool for inferring karyotype evolution. Comparative chromosome painting and related techniques are now considered to be the most powerful approaches in comparative genome studies. Homologies can be identified with high accuracy using molecularly defined DNA probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on chromosomes of different species. Chromosome painting data are now available for members of nearly all mammalian orders. In most orders, there are species with rates of chromosome evolution that can be considered as {\lq}default{\rq} rates. The number of rearrangements that have become fixed in evolutionary history seems comparatively low, bearing in mind the 180 million years of the mammalian radiation.

But it{\rq}s not. In fact, to celebrate Darwin{\rq}s signal achievements we would -- quite literally -- have to go out of our way. Why is this? The reasons relate to the specifics of Anglophone geography{\rq}s history and its present constitution (see Castree, 2009). During the Victorian and Edwardian periods, less than salutary uses were made of Darwin{\rq}s ideas by many of the first university geographers. A toxic mixture of environmental determinism and Social Darwinism infected a good deal of the {\lq}scholarship{\rq} published a century or more ago. This is not a past we{\rq}d wish to revisit as part of any commemoration of Charles Darwin. But even supposing this history was less tainted, the fact remains that today an awful lot of academic geography is intellectually remote from the contemporary research and teaching that is a direct result of Darwin{\rq}s theory of evolution. Whether we{\rq}re considering developmental biology, evolutionary psychology, or the neo-Darwinian critique of the {\lq}intelligent design hypothesis{\rq} (otherwise known as creationism??) the situation is the same: in the main, though very open to ideas from other disciplines, Anglophone geography has only tenuous connections with those subjects and debates in which Darwin{\rq}s ideas cast a long shadow.",

The average litter size at emergence was 4.2 and there was a significant difference between litter sizes at independence on reserves with lions (2.9 cubs) compared to those without (4.7 cubs). Age specific mortality was higher in the first 4 years of life (40-70\%) than year 5 to 9 (0\%) and increased after year nine. (Compare to Namibia!). Mortality of adult cheetahs was higher on reserves with lions compared to those without and there was a significant positive relationship (R² = 0.56, P < 0.05) between cheetah mortality and the density of large predators on these reserves. We conclude that the reproductive rate of cheetahs that have been reintroduced to fenced reserves is high. Mortality of cubs and young adult cheetahs is elevated in the presence of lions and other carnivores.

Livestock-guarding dogs could provide an effective alternative to such lethal control by mitigating depredation losses. Although this information is available in North America, the cost-effectiveness of guarding dogs has not been studied in other areas experiencing large carnivore depredation such as South Africa, where the socio-economic context is very different from that of North America. We assessed the costs and benefits of 97 livestock-guarding dogs working on 94 farms in South Africa between 2005 and 2011 by reviewing data collected from questionnaires on perceived depredation losses prior to and during guarding dog placement, rates of guarding dog behavioral problems, removals, and pre-senile mortality. Perceived livestock depredation ceased in 91\% of guarding dog placements, with gross mean annual financial savings US$ 3,189/farm. Estimated annual program costs per year of the livestock-guarding dog program were US$ 2,780. However, 16\% of guarding dogs had reported behavioral problems, with inattentiveness cited as the most common problem. Twelve percent of guarding dogs were removed from the program because of behavioral problems. Premature death was observed in 22\% of guarding dogs, most often due to snake bites. Participating farmer tolerance toward cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), as well as cheetah-sighting frequency, appeared to increase during participation in the livestock guarding dog program. If further corrective behavioral and snake-aversion training were implemented, guarding dogs may offer a cost-effective method of non-lethal predator control and could potentially contribute to the long-term mitigation of human--carnivore conflict in South Africa.",

Much of the information in these publications was derived from southern Africa. Our aim with this book is to provide information from local sources, which in many cases may mean no information at all. Only information specific to Namibia has been included in this book, from notes on Namibian specimens, Namibian ethnobotanical studies, and so on. The book discusses and maps the 391 grasses indigenous to Namibia---10\% of the total indigenous flora.

Information included in this publication was extracted from the SPMNDB database, the Flora database (the WIND database that contains information like ethnobotany, common names, and so forth), and literature surveys. We used the following process: • First, all grass specimens in the National Collection were computerised and then quality controlled. • Then, data on abundance, life form, habitat, notes, ethnobotany, and common names were extracted from the SPMNDB database. • Voucher specimens were selected from Prodromus einer Flora von S{\"u}dwestafrika (Launert 1970), other literature, or from specimens in WIND and PRE. • Finally, information on conservation status, distribution elsewhere in the world, ethnobotany, and common names were extracted from relevant literature sources and the Flora database. Nutritional values were not included because of insufficient data. No grass species have yet been evaluated as Threatened on the Plant Red Data List for Namibia (Craven \& Loots 2002).

@book{OConnell_et_al_2011,
	abstract = "This book deals with equipment known as ``camera traps,'' which are used to detect wild animals. The inspiration for this book was the 9th International Mammal Congress held in Sapporo, Japan, in August 2005. At that time, camera traps had become sufficiently popular as a field sampling technique to warrant a separate symposium in the Congress. The ten presentations given in Sapporo that focused on camera traps encompassed a variety of mammal species, ranging from bats to large carnivores, and included surveys and studies from various countries and habitats. The analytical approaches that were used to make inferences about the target populations were somewhat limited, however, and that sparked an interest in the production of this volume, which focuses primarily on (1) the sampling methodologies of using camera traps and (2) the analytical techniques best suited to make sound inferences from photographic evidence. ... More than a decade has passed since the publication of the landmark papers by Karanth (Karanth 1995; Karanth and Nichols 1998) that discussed estimation of tiger abundance and density from camera trap data. On the heels of that work, Karanth et al. (2004) explored the potential application of camera traps as scientific tools and addressed questions such as why sample, what to sample, and how to sample rare or elusive animals in an inferential framework. Karanth et al. (2006) later demonstrated how camera trap data can also be used to assess changes in vital rates for tigers over long periods of time. We viewed it as a sign of encouragement for this technique when Karanth et al. (2004), among others in the volume by Thompson (2004), received a favorable review even in a journal devoted to surveys of crypto-zoological creatures such as Bigfoot (Arment 2005)! Given the notable increase in the scientific use of camera traps over the past several years, we believed that the time was right for a thorough review that details the various aspects of camera trapping, focusing on the estimation techniques that are currently available for analyzing the scientific information (i.e., photographs) and for making strong inferences. Despite the widespread use of camera traps, many of the techniques best suited for data analysis and statistical inference remain somewhat of an enigma to many practitioners. All too often, the concepts underlying the approaches to inference are not presented adequately or are scattered throughout the scientific literature. In this volume, we provide the conceptual frameworks underlying the inference methods themselves, and the manner in which these methods can contribute to the larger endeavors of science and management.",

We investigated the timing of waterhole use by African fauna using webcams to determine whether this mode of data collection was viable, to determine whether animals drank randomly throughout the day, whether there were differences between guilds in waterhole use and finally we created a relative rank of water dependency by comparing waterhole use with the relative abundance of species at Kruger and Pilanesberg National Parks. We used webcams sited at waterholes in South Africa{\rq}s Kruger and Pilanesberg, Madikwe Game Reserve and Tembe Elephant Park, and Botswana{\rq}s Mashatu Game Reserve to remotely monitor waterhole use at random times throughout the day. Over the 16-month study period, 1546 observations were made of 30 species at waterholes, with elephants (Loxodonta africana) and impala (Aepyceros melampus) being the most frequently observed species. There was a high degree of diurnal overlap in waterhole use amongst the herbivores, but they partitioned the time of peak waterhole use. Large predators were largely nocturnal while their prey was invariably diurnal. The index of relative water use showed that hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) and blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) were highly water-dependent, whereas lion (Panthera leo), spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) and kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) appear relatively water independent. African fauna may partition waterhole use to avoid competition and predation.

However, more data does not necessarily yield greater knowledge in understanding animal ecology and conservation. In this paper, we provide a review of the major benefits, problems and potential misuses of GPS/Argos technology to animal ecology and conservation. Benefits are obvious, and include the ability to collect fine-scale spatio-temporal location data on many previously impossible to study animals, such as ocean-going fish, migratory songbirds and long-distance migratory mammals. These benefits come with significant problems, however, imposed by frequent collar failures and high cost, which often results in weaker study design, reduced sample sizes and poorer statistical inference. In addition, we see the divorcing of biologists from a field-based understanding of animal ecology to be a growing problem. Despite these difficulties, GPS devices have provided significant benefits, particularly in the conservation and ecology of wide-ranging species. We conclude by offering suggestions for ecologists on which kinds of ecological questions would currently benefit the most from GPS/Argos technology, and where the technology has been potentially misused. Significant conceptual challenges remain, however, including the links between movement and behaviour, and movement and population dynamics.

High levels of genetic diversity and exceptionally low levels of population differentiation have been found in the Cape buffalo compared to other African savannah ungulates. Patterns of genetic variation reveal large effective population sizes and indicate that Cape buffalos have historically been interbreeding across considerable distances. Throughout much of its range, the Cape buffalo is now largely confined to protected areas due to habitat fragmentation and increasing human population densities, possibly resulting in genetic erosion. Ten buffalo populations in Kenya and Uganda were examined using seventeen microsatellite markers to assess the regional genetic structure and the effect of protected area size on measures of genetic diversity. Two nested levels of genetic structure were identified: a higher level partitioning populations into two clusters separated by the Victoria Nile and a lower level distinguishing seven genetic clusters, each defined by one or two study populations. Although relatively small geographic distances separate most of the study populations, the level of genetic differentiation found here is comparable to that among pan-African populations. Overall, correlations between conservancy area and indices of genetic diversity suggest buffalo populations inhabiting small parks are showing signs of genetic erosion, stressing the need for more active management of such populations. Our findings raise concerns about the future of other African savannah ungulates with lower population sizes and inferior dispersal capabilities compared with the buffalo.",

New statistical approaches include data-intensive techniques such as kriging and non-linear generalized regression models for habitat use. In addition, mechanistic home-range models, derived from models of animal movement behaviour, promise to offer new insights into how home ranges emerge as the result of specific patterns of movements by individuals in response to their environment. Traditional methods such as kernel density estimators are likely to remain popular because of their ease of use. Large datasets make it possible to apply these methods over relatively short periods of time such as weeks or months, and these estimates may be analysed using mixed effects models, offering another approach to studying temporal variation in space-use patterns.

SAGA has been under development since 2001 at the University of G{\"o}ttingen (the SAGA development team, has since moved to University of Hamburg), Germany, with aim of simplifying the implementation of new algorithms for spatial data analysis. In 2004, most of SAGA{\rq}s source code was published using an Open Source Software license. The functionality of SAGA is described in B{\"o}hner et al. (2002) and B{\"o}hner et al. (2008); the software design, methods, and usage are explained in detail in Conrad (2007). GRASS GIS, now one of the eight initial Software Projects of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo), is probably the most known open source GIS software in the world. Its functionality and usage are described in detail in Neteler and Mitasova (2008). GRASS itself is a collection of modules (they vary from version to version). Although originally a Linux-based project, the most recent version of GRASS (6.3; development version) is now also available for MS Windows machines. GRASS is a much larger project than SAGA considering the number of developers/institutions involved, although their functionality considering the DEM analysis is about similar. Both SAGA and GRASS are increasingly rich considering the functionality they offer: the latest version of SAGA (2.0.3.) contains 48 libraries with 300 modules; GRASS 6.3 contains over 350 routines. Both in fact provide more functionality for the analysis of DEMs than proprietary low-end products such as the basic installation of ArcGIS 9.2. By linking SAGA/GRASS with R environment for statistical computing, a powerful combination is created that allows fusion of GIS and statistical functionality in the same code (Grohmann, 2004; Brenning, 2008). In this article we present the results of a comparative analysis of performances of the two GIS software for the analysis of elevation data. We focus on DEM generation, extraction of hydrological features (stream networks), and extraction of gridded DEM derivatives. We will base our comparison on objective and subjective criteria: measures of accuracy, processing speed, but then also on the user{\rq}s satisfaction following questionnaires. Our intention is not really to name the winner, but to see what the basic differences are, and to suggest ways to combine the strengths of the two packages.",

	abstract = "While cougar predation may have compensatory effects on ungulate populations in some cases (Hornocker 1970, Laundre 2005), although detailed experimental evidence is often required to clearly implicate predation as a major limiting or regulatory factor for prey (Boutin 1992), there have been several documented cases where cougar predation is the primary cause of population decline (Wehausen 1996, Festa-Bianchet et al. 2006). Indeed in some cases, cougars have taken prey to the brink of local extinction (Sweitzer et al. 1997, Logan and Sweanor 2001), leaving little doubt about the potential for predation by cougars to negatively affect the population viability of prey. Cougar predation, therefore, can be considered to have both positive and negative effects, depending on perspective and context. To optimize these effects through management, a firm understanding of cougar predatory behavior is required. This paper examines one important aspect of this behavior---prey specialization by individuals---which can have important implications for the extent that cougars influence populations of their prey. We begin by discussing cougar predation in multiprey systems because it is in these systems that the effects of cougar predation are most pronounced and because this is where strong individual preferences for a particular species of prey (specialization) is possible. Next, we review the literature as it pertains to cougar prey specialization and also provide some new data from the first year of an ongoing study of cougar predatory behavior along the eastern slopes of Alberta{\rq}s Rocky Mountains. Finally, we discuss the management implications of prey specialization by cougars and the gaps in our knowledge that still need to be addressed by future research to improve the performance of management actions.",

	abstract = "Conservation management often focuses on counteracting the adverse effects of human activities on threatened populations. However, conservation measures may unintentionally relax selection by allowing the {\lq}survival of the not-so-fit{\rq}, increasing the risk of fixation of maladaptive traits. Here, we report such a case in the critically-endangered Chatham Island black robin (Petroica traversi) which, in 1980, was reduced to a single breeding pair. Following this bottleneck, some females were observed to lay eggs on the rims of their nests. Rim eggs left in place always failed to hatch. To expedite population recovery, rim eggs were repositioned inside nests, yielding viable hatchlings. Repositioning resulted in rapid growth of the black robin population, but by 1989 over 50\% of all females were laying rim eggs. We used an exceptional, species-wide pedigree to consider both recessive and dominant models of inheritance over all plausible founder genotype combinations at a biallelic and possibly sex-linked locus. The pattern of rim laying is best fitted as an autosomal dominant Mendelian trait. Using a phenotype permutation test we could also reject the null hypothesis of non-heritability for this trait in favour of our best-fitting model of heritability. Data collected after intervention ceased shows that the frequency of rim laying has strongly declined, and that this trait is maladaptive. This episode yields an important lesson for conservation biology: fixation of maladaptive traits could render small threatened populations completely dependent on humans for reproduction, irreversibly compromising the long term viability of populations humanity seeks to conserve.",

	abstract = "1. Apex predators are often assumed to be dietary generalists and, by feeding on prey from multiple basal nutrient sources, serve to couple discrete food webs. But there is increasing evidence that individual level dietary specialization may be common in many species, and this has not been investigated for many marine apex predators. 2. Because of their position at or near the top of many marine food webs, and the possibility that they can affect populations of their prey and induce trophic cascades, it is important to understand patterns of dietary specialization in shark populations. 3. Stable isotope values from body tissues with different turnover rates were used to quantify patterns of individual specialization in two species of {\lq}generalist{\rq} sharks (bull sharks, Carcharhinus leucas, and tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier). 4. Despite wide population-level isotopic niche breadths in both species, isotopic values of individual tiger sharks varied across tissues with different turnover rates. The population niche breadth was explained mostly by variation within individuals suggesting tiger sharks are true generalists. In contrast, isotope values of individual bull sharks were stable through time and their wide population level niche breadth was explained by variation among specialist individuals. 5. Relative resource abundance and spatial variation in food-predation risk tradeoffs may explain the differences in patterns of specialization between shark species. 6. The differences in individual dietary specialization between tiger sharks and bull sharks results in different functional roles in coupling or compartmentalizing distinct food webs. 7. Individual specialization may be an important feature of trophic dynamics of highly mobile marine top predators and should be explicitly considered in studies of marine food webs and the ecological role of top predators.

These quantities, however, are difficult to obtain for rare and elusive species, where even intensive sampling effort can yield sparse data. Here, we combine data from camera-trapping and noninvasive genetic sampling (scat surveys) of a jaguar population in the Caatinga of northeastern Brazil, where the species is threatened and little studied. We analyze data of both survey types separately and jointly in the framework of spatial capture--recapture. Density estimates were 1.45 (±0.46) for the camera-trap data alone, 2.03 (±0.77) for the genetic data alone, and 1.57 (±0.43) and 2.45 (±0.70) for the two methods, respectively, in the joint analysis. Density and other parameters were estimated more precisely in the joint model. Particularly the differences in movement between males and females were estimated much more precisely when combining both data sources, especially compared to the genetic data set alone. When compared to a previous non-spatial capture--recapture approach, present density estimates were more precise, demonstrating the superior statistical performance of spatial over non-spatial capture recapture models.

One of the highlights of 2008 was the arrival in November of two black rhinos --a 6 year old male and a 3 year old female. The release of these rhinos on CCF land is the culmination of years of work and negotiations as part of our plan to restore the land to its natural state. Beginning this year, CCF has a genetics laboratory that is set up to process scat (faecal) samples for DNA extraction and analysis. This will allow us to process samples locally, decreasing the dependence of Namibia from other countries and allowing Namibian students to be exposed to genetic research and conservation at CCF. The main planned project includes cheetah identification based on scat samples to estimate animal density. In July, after a year of planning, CCF re-introduced five of its cheetahs into the NamibRand Nature Reserve in the south west of Namibia bordering the Namib-Naukluft Park. CCF and NamibRand have worked closely with the Ministry of Environment and Tourism to plan this release. In August 2008 the cheetahs were recaptured due to their movement onto a livestock farm, and then released again in December. In the hope that it may encourage the males to stay more on the plains, two female cheetahs from CCF were also taken to the Reserve and placed in the 50-ha holding camp. As soon as the males are hunting regularly, it is envisioned that the female cheetahs will then be released using the same methods. CCF's Livestock Guarding Dog Program is considered one of the most successful conservation projects in regards to human / predator challenges, and currently involves 121 working dogs. A highlight of the programme at the end of this year was the placement of one male puppy in the Mara Conservancy in Kenya to live amongst the local Masai and guard their livestock. In addition, CCF received two new breeding dogs early in 2008, thanks to the SPOTS Foundation in Holland and two generous Turkish Kangal breeders. The need to address capacity building and training of conservation scientists, educators and agriculture officers in cheetah range countries was identified by both the Eastern and Southern African Regional Strategic Planning meetings for Cheetah in 2007. Consequently, for the first time this year, CCF held two courses on Integrated Livestock and Predator Management and Cheetah Conservation Biology for over 30 international conservationists from cheetah range countries around the world. The courses are part of a commitment to running a number of international conservation courses over a three-year period. CCF Bush (Pty) Ltd was again inspected and approved by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) for certificate renewal, and its sales nearly doubled in 2008. Bushblok was selected from over 700 nominations to receive the 2008 Tech Award in the Intel Environment Category. I was also honoured with the first Zoological Society of San Diego's Conservation Medal of the Lifetime Achievement Award, the Gold Medal award from the Society of Woman Geographers (SWG), and had the privilege of being a finalist for the Indianapolis Prize, which was deservedly awarded to Dr. George Schaller. Ensuring the cheetah's survival presents many challenges. Our systematic approaches have resulted in the stabilisation of the cheetah population in Namibia. However, the cheetah must survive in its entire range if we are to ensure the health of this species. Thus, we must continue to expand our efforts throughout the world, and particularly where the cheetah still exists. In the years to come, CCF will continue to focus on developing best practices in research, education and ecology to create a sustainable model from which all other endangered species may benefit, beyond our lifetimes, and on a global basis.",

We surveyed potential predation sites during summer-fall 2000 and summer 2001 to identify prey composition (n = 74; 3-388 days post predation) and record predation-site variables (n = 97; 3-270 days post predation). We developed a model to estimate probability that a cougar killed a large mammal from data collected at GPS location clusters where the probability of predation increased with number of nights (defined as locations at 2200, 0200, or 0500 hr) of cougar presence within a 200-m radius (P< 0.001). Mean estimated cougar predation rates for large mammals were 7.3 days/kill for subadult females (1-2.5 yr; n = 3, 90\% CI: 6.3 to 9.9), 7.0 days/kill for adult females (n = 2, 90\% CI: 5.8 to 10.8), 5.4 days/kill for family groups (females with young; n = 3, 90\% CI: 4.5 to 8.4), 9.5 days/kill for a subadult male (1-2.5 yr; n = 1, 90\% CI: 6.9 to 16.4), and 7.8 days/kill for adult males (n = 2, 90\% CI: 6.8 to 10.7).

We detected 45 deer (Odocoileus spp.), 15 elk (Cervuselaphus), 6 pronghorn (Antilocapraamericana),2 livestock, 1 moose (Alces alces), and 6 small mammals at cougar predation sites. Comparisons between cougar sexes suggested that females selected mule deer and males selected elk (P < 0.001). Cougars averaged 3.0 nights on pronghorn carcasses, 3.4 nights on deer carcasses, and 6.0 nights on elk carcasses. Most cougar predation (81.7\%) occurred between 1901-0500 hr and peaked from 2201-0200 hr (31.7\%).

	abstract = "Cheetah cub survival on the Serengeti Plains (SP) was found to be exceptionally low, because of high predation rates, thought to be especially by lions. These results have contributed to the perception that cheetah cubs are particularly vulnerable to predation, and that areas with large carnivores may not be suitable for cheetah conservation. Here we show that survival of cheetah cubs in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park was seven times higher than on the SP and, although predation was the most common form of mortality, lions were not found to be involved. Moreover, we suggest that scrutiny of the Serengeti data does not unequivocally prove the dominance of lions as predators of cheetah cubs there. We discuss these findings in the context of cheetah conservation, suggesting that further research on coexistence between cheetahs and other carnivores should receive attention and that the high mortality rates of cubs found on the SP may not be as widespread as is commonly believed. Furthermore, we recommend that maintaining the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning should receive more attention in carnivore conservation.",

	abstract = "The literature on cheetah Acinonyx jubatus ecology is dominated by studies on the Serengeti Plains (SNP) in East Africa. Because of this and the cheetah{\rq}s hunting strategy it is generally considered to be a predator that prefers open grassland plains. However, cheetahs also inhabit a range of bush, scrub and woodland habitats. A field study using direct observations of radio-collared individuals in the woodland savanna habitat of the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, and a literature review of studies across savanna habitats examined cheetah predation, hunting behaviour and habitat use in relation to prey composition, cover availability and kleptoparasitism. The cheetah{\rq}s main prey is medium-sized herbivores, with a bias towards male prey. The group size and sex of the hunting cheetah may influence the results of prey selection studies as male coalitions tend to take larger prey than females. Cheetahs initiated more hunts and had a higher success rate in the open woodland savanna of the KNP compared to other available habitats with thicker bush, and in other wooded savanna areas they also prefer more open habitat for hunting. Although they appear to have shorter chase distances in more wooded habitats, hunting success appears to be slightly higher in open grassland habitat. Woody vegetation appears to obstruct the cheetah{\rq}s high-speed hunting strategy, thereby lowering hunting success. However, cheetahs use cover for stalking prey and open habitats with bordering woodlands, or patches of cover are considered preferred cheetah habitats. In these habitats, cheetahs can stalk closer to their prey using available cover, but also successfully pursue their prey into available open spaces. Across African savanna ecosystems, cheetahs appear to be kleptoparasitised less in more wooded habitats. Therefore they may also prefer these habitats because they provide greater concealment from kleptoparasites. Our study suggests that the cheetah is more adaptable to habitat variability than is often thought and is not only a successful hunter on open grassland plains.",

The model is a hierarchical model composed of two components: a point process model describing the distribution of individuals in space (or their home range centers) and a model describing the observation of individuals in traps. We suppose that trap- and individual-specific capture probabilities are a function of distance between individual home range centers and trap locations. We show that the models can be regarded as generalized linear mixed models, where the individual home range centers are random effects. We adopt a Bayesian framework for inference under these models using a formulation based on data augmentation. We apply the models to camera trapping data on tigers from the Nagarahole Reserve, India, collected over 48 nights in 2006. For this study, 120 camera locations were used, but cameras were only operational at 30 locations during any given sample occasion.

How space use is controlled by the habitat preference function w depends on the characteristic width of the animals{\rq} redistribution kernel: when the redistribution kernel is wide relative to variation in w, u∗ ∝ w, whereas when it is narrow relative to variation in w, u ∗ ∝ w2. In addition, we analyze the behavior at discontinuities in w which occur at habitat type boundaries, and simulate the dynamics of space use given two-dimensional prey-availability data, exploring the effect of the redistribution kernel width.

Losses in plant productivity, biodiversity of plant and animal communities, and carbon storage are occurring as a result of livestock grazing. Holistic management (HM) has been proposed as a means of restoring degraded deserts and grasslands and reversing climate change. The fundamental approach of this system is based on frequently rotating livestock herds to mimic native ungulates reacting to predators in order to break up biological soil crusts and trample plants and soils to promote restoration. This review could find no peer-reviewed studies that show that this management approach is superior to conventional grazing systems in outcomes. Any claims of success due to HM are likely due to the management aspects of goal setting, monitoring, and adapting to meet goals, not the ecological principles embodied in HM. Ecologically, the application of HM principles of trampling and intensive foraging are as detrimental to plants, soils, water storage, and plant productivity as are conventional grazing systems. Contrary to claims made that HM will reverse climate change, the scientific evidence is that global greenhouse gas emissions are vastly larger than the capacity of worldwide grasslands and deserts to store the carbon emitted each year.",

We conducted a 3-year study on 11 South African livestock farms, examining costs and benefits of lethal and non-lethal conflict mitigation methods. Farmers used existing lethal control in the first year and switched to guardian animals (dogs Canis familiaris and alpacas Lama pacos) or livestock protection collars for the following 2 years. During the first year the mean cost of livestock protection was USD 3.30 per head of stock and the mean cost of depredation was USD 20.11 per head of stock.

	abstract = "The invention of the camera trap by George Shiras in the late 1890s and its widespread adoption by hunters 100 years later has armed scientists and managers with a powerful noninvasive tool to collect data on wildlife (Sanderson and Trolle 2005). Imagery from camera traps supports ecological investigations, inventory and monitoring networks, and cataloging biodiversity (e.g., Karanth and Nichols 1998, MacKenzie et al. 2005, Trolle et al. 2007, Stein et al. 2008). Such use of camera traps continues to expand in the number of cameras deployed and images taken (Kays and Slauson 2008, Kays et al. 2009). Yet this increase creates a paradox. While practitioners seek more data to improve analyses, they buckle under mounds of imagery piling up before them. This situation engenders four problems. First, because cataloging imagery is slow, image identification lags behind acquisition, and many images remain unidentified. Second, user entry is tedious, causing errors (Maydanchik 2007). Third, inconsistent filing and naming conventions complicate data retrieval and sharing (Chaudhary et al. 2010). Fourth, the struggle to keep pace with the acquisition and management of data from existing camera traps slows the deployment of additional cameras (and subsequent data acquisition). These four problems stem from two general issues: inability to address volumes of imagery, and the lack of systematic organization. To address these issues we offer a three-step, standardized procedure to retrieve, label, store, analyze, and disseminate camera trap data. The methodology relies solely on open-source software and two computer programs we created. Our procedure is fast and simple and does not require hand data entry, thus greatly reducing data entry errors (Maydanchik 2007). Output from our analysis software can be directly imported to other analysis programs (e.g., PRESENCE (MacKenzie et al. 2005)), and standard spreadsheets used elsewhere (TEAM Network 2008). The analysis program also calculates 18 popular parameters commonly examined by ecologists and wildlife managers (Table 1). These 18 parameters serve as examples, as the potential for expansion is self-evident. We illustrate these parameters by summarizing the analysis of data obtained from a camera-trapping project in south-central Arizona (~30,000 images) and Suriname, South America (~75,000 images). We are presently organizing camera programs throughout the southwestern USA following this methodology (i.e., presently ~300,000 images from Arizona and New Mexico, and building).",

However, Ruaha{\rq}s carnivore populations cause intense conflict with local people, mainly due to livestock depredation, and are exposed to alarming rates of retaliatory killing, especially on village land adjacent to RNP. Depredation risk is likely to be influenced by both habitat features and livestock husbandry, but the specific environmental risk factors, and relative importance of habitat and husbandry, have never been assessed in this landscape. Here, we assessed which ecogeographic variables (EGVs) were associated with depredation risk for grazing livestock on village land, and generated a predictive map of large carnivore predation risk, based on species distribution modelling algorithms (SDMs). Secondly, we investigated the relative influence of husbandry and EGVs on depredation risk of enclosed stock, based on a generalized linear model. Grazing livestock predation risk was higher closer to rivers, and in areas of lower elevation and low percentage of tree cover, with 41\% of the area mapped as high-risk. For enclosed stock, predation risk was mostly influenced by low percentage of tree cover and increased rainfall, with no discernible influence of current husbandry, which suggests that traditional husbandry was insufficient to outweigh the innate predation risks associated with high-risk landscape areas. Adopting new husbandry methods, such as specialised guarding dogs and fortified livestock enclosures, could be valuable for reducing depredation and carnivore killing in the Ruaha landscape.",

If poaching continues to escalate, a tipping point may eventually be reached forcing the population into decline for the first time in 50-100 years reversing one of the greatest conservation success stories. The trade-sceptics, i.e. most rhino range states outside southern Africa, many influential international NGO{\rq}s and a number of Parties to CITES are at loggerheads with the pro-trade lobby. Both trade or no trade scenarios carry risks that could negatively impact South Africa{\rq}s rhino populations. Taking into account the facts that the mechanisms for controlling a legal trade in South Africa are not yet in place, that the number of rhino horns in private stockpiles are uncertain, and that some private rhino owners are not yet compliant with permitting regulations, it is likely that lifting the moratorium at the present time will lead to laundering of illegal horn into legal stockpiles as well as smuggling of horn out of the country. A secure, national electronic permitting system and rhino database for all permitting issues for live rhinos and rhino horn, including the marking and identification of horn using DNA profiling, and the full disclosure of horn stockpiles of private rhino owners must be operational at least one year before the 17th Conference of Parties that is due to be held in 2016. Many Parties to CITES are unlikely to vote in favor of lifting the international trade ban before this happens Economists must also decide on a system to control and regulate trade in rhino horn. This should be done for both national and international trade because legalizing international trade may turn out to be the only way to reduce poaching in the future if law enforcement continues to fail.",

	abstract = "The impacts of introduced predators including wild dogs, the European Red Fox and the feral cat cost the Australian community in excess of 60 million dollars annually through stock losses and control programmes. These figures however don{\rq}t take into account the emotional and social impacts of predation by introduced predators on landholders and graziers across the country. Wild dog and fox predation in some instances has become so great that landholders are being forced out of sheep and goat enterprises because they are no longer financially viable due to impacts. Participation in coordinated wild dog and fox control programs is varied across the country. A range of factors influence these participation rates including the type of livestock being produced, loss of labour in rural communities, greater ownership of rural land by large companies who can absorb the cost of predation, an increase in conservation estate across the country where management outcomes differ from production outcomes and changes in property ownership from farming enterprises to lifestyle blocks. The National Wild Dog Facilitator, Greg Mifsud, met a large number of graziers and producers who showed great interest in using guardian dogs to protect livestock from predation, through implementing the Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre project ``Facilitating the Strategic Management of Wild Dog throughout Australia''. These producers were concerned about the lack of information to effectively apply livestock guardian dogs to their production practices. This sentiment was also highlighted in a series of predator control field days that discussed the use of livestock guardian dogs conducted by the Leading Sheep, Agforce Queensland and Biosecurity Queensland across western Queensland in September 2008. The development of a best practice manual for the use of guardian dogs to protect livestock will allow land holders to be proactive by preventing predation rather that reacting to attacks. The use of guardian dogs has been proven to be a cost effective means of managing predation when applied properly. However producers are hesitant about using livestock guardian dogs due to hearing stories regarding poorly managed or trained dogs that have caused problems for neighbours or have run off never to be seen again. Poor training is responsible for wrecking many working dogs regardless of breed or the dogs potential and a decision to use guardian dogs shouldn{\rq}t be made based on the poor examples illustrated by these horror stories.",

These changes are integrated into the tissues of apex predators over space and time and can be quantified using stable isotopes in the inert feathers of historical and contemporary avian specimens. We measured d 13 C and d 15 N values in Flesh-footed Shearwaters (Puffinus carneipes) from Western and South Australia from 1936--2011. The Flesh-footed Shearwaters more than doubled their trophic trophic niche (from 3.91 +- 1.37 \%0² to 10.00 +- 1.79 \%0²), and dropped an entire trophic level in 75 years (predicted d 15 N decreased from +16.9 \%0 to + 13.5 \%0, and d 13 C from +-16.9 \& to +-17.9 \&) -- the largest change in d 15 N yet reported in any marine bird, suggesting a relatively rapid shift in the composition of the Indian Ocean food web, or changes in baseline d 13 C and d 15 N values. A stronger El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation results in a weaker Leeuwin Current in Western Australia, and decreased Flesh-footed Shearwater d 13 C and d 15 N. Current climate forecasts predict this trend to continue, leading to increased oceanic {\lq}tropicalization{\rq} and potentially competition between Flesh-footed Shearwaters and more tropical sympatric species with expanding ranges. Flesh-footed Shearwater populations are declining, and current conservation measures aimed primarily at bycatch mitigation are not restoring populations. Widespread shifts in foraging, as shown here, may explain some of the reported decline. An improved understanding and ability to mitigate the impacts of global climactic changes is therefore critical to the long-term sustainability of this declining species.",

In the field of conservation genetics, this controversy is manifested in the diverse viewpoints of molecular systematists, population biologists, and evolutionary (and quantitative) geneticists. A resolution of these viewpoints is proposed here, based on the premise that preserving particular objects (genes, species, or ecosystems) is not the ultimate goal of conservation. In order to be successful, conservation efforts must preserve the processes of life. This task requires the identification and protection of diverse branches in the tree of life (phylogenetics), the maintenance of life-support systems for organisms (ecology), and the continued adaptation of organisms to changing environments (evolution). None of these objectives alone is sufficient to preserve the threads of life across time. Under this temporal perspective, molecular genetic technologies have applications in all three conservation agendas; DNA sequence comparisons serve the phylogenetic goals, population genetic markers serve the ecological goals, quantitative genetics and genome explorations serve the evolutionary goals.

	abstract = "Error bars commonly appear in figures in publications, but experimental biologists are often unsure how they should be used and interpreted. In this article we illustrate some basic features of error bars and explain how they can help communicate data and assist correct interpretation. Error bars may show confidence intervals, standard errors, standard deviations, or other quantities. Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent. We suggest eight simple rules to assist with effective use and interpretation of error bars. Rule 1: when showing error bars, always describe in the figure legends what they are. Rule 2: the value of n (i.e., the sample size, or the number of independently performed experiments) must be stated in the figure legend. Rule 3: error bars and statistics should only be shown for independently repeated experiments, and never for replicates. Rule 4: because experimental biologists are usually trying to compare experimen- tal results with controls, it is usually appropriate to show inferential error bars, such as SE or CI, rather than SD.However, if n is very small (for example n = 3), rather than showing error bars and statistics, it is better to simply plot the individual data points. Rule 5: 95\% CIs capture μ on 95\% of occasions, so you can be 95\% confident your interval includes μ. SE bars can be doubled in width to get the approximate 95\% CI, provided n is 10 or more. If n = 3, SE bars must be multiplied by 4 to get the approximate 95\% CI. Rule 6: when n = 3, and double the SE bars don{\rq}t overlap, P < 0.05, and if double the SE bars just touch, P is close to 0.05. If n is 10 or more, a gap of SE indicates P ≈ 0.05 and a gap of 2 SE indicates P ≈ 0.01. Rule 7: with 95\% CIs and n = 3, overlap of one full arm indicates P ≈ 0.05, and overlap of half an arm indicates P ≈ 0.01 Rule 8: in the case of repeated measurements on the same group (e.g., of animals, individuals, cultures, or reactions), CIs or SE bars are irrelevant to comparisons within the same group.",

Following a brief historical summary of similar ill-advised critiques of Q methodology in the 80 years since its introduction, responses are presented to various of the points raised: on the nature of subjectivity, the universe of subjective communicability (concourse) and samples drawn from it, the role of factor analysis and factor interpretation, the forced Q-sort distribution, the ratio between the number of participants and the number of statements in the Q sample, and sources of researcher bias. In the eight decades since it was first proposed by William Stephenson, Q methodology has spawned a vibrant community of active practitioners, and during that time it has also attracted a steady stream of criticism from authors who show little familiarity with the literature and community of Q method and whose criticisms repeat substantial misunderstandings of its mathematical and practical aspects. Like the Medici refusing to look through Galileo{\rq}s telescope, these critics have failed to engage personally with Q in order to see if their abstract critiques hold up in practice. Unfortunately, the recent article by Kampen and Tam{\'a}s is little different in this respect. We invite anyone with concerns or doubts about Q to look through the telescope by reading the Q literature, joining the Q-Method listserv, and most importantly conducting Q methodological research. We are confident that such engagement will lead, if not to a love of Q, at least to a better-informed strain of criticism.",

	abstract = "During the last decade, genetic problems potentially faced by smallpopulations have constituted a central topic in conservation biology (1). Genetic theory predicts that inbreeding between members of small populations will reveal deleterious recessive alleles,whichmay be manifested in lowered fecundity, high infant mortality, and reduced growth rates that could eventually drive a population to extinction (2). In addition, loss of heterozygosity may reduce a population's ability to respondto future environmental change, such that the probability of extinctionis increased or, at best, opportunities for evolution are limited (3). Consequently,genetic considerations play a central rolein identifying risks to wild and captive populations (4). Direct observation of lairs and circumstantial evidence surrounding cub disap- pearances in many instances enabled the causes of mortality to be determined. Predation was by far the most important cause (35.5 out of 48.5 cubs;one litter size was unknown but estimatedas 3.5, the mean size); four cubs were abandoned by their mothers when prey was scarce, seven died of fire and exposure, and two may have been inviable. Predation on young cubs is therefore a strong candidate for explaining why cheetahshave low population densities in comparison with lions and spotted hyenas in manyareas of Africa. In practical terms, the cheetah case history highlights the necessity of carrying out detailed ecological studies of endangered species in order to determine environmental causesof population decline (40). Studies collecting ecological data require a longer time to complete than those collecting genetic samples and are labor intensive but may be the key to understanding and hence preventing population extinctions.",

The minimum estimate derived from direct enumeration of marked and unmarked individuals is between 100-103 individuals. Assessment of the adult and subadult population using the Lincoln-Petersen estimator and the software program NOREMARK gives a figure between 92 and 125. The current estimate is below the previous estimate of between 113 and 140 lions. Lion densities of 1.2 adult and subadult lions/100 km^ in the semi-arid southern Kalahari are considerably lower than those in more mesic regions.

The genus Acacia, as Peter Kershaw has often told us, may be widely present in the landscape, but its pollen is seldom found in any abundance. The pollen grains are heavy and probably not capable of long-distance transport, and even where they dominate the vegetation, their pollen is greatly under-represented. Compounding the problem, Acacia pollen tends to break up into individual units that are difficult to identify. However, as we hope to show in our contribution celebrating Peter{\rq}s work, the poor representation of acacias in palaeoenvironmental records is more than compensated by its dominating presence in what has been described as one of the longest running, most acrimonious debates in the history of botanical nomenclature (Brummitt 2011).",

	abstract = "Recently developed spatial capture--recapture (SCR) models represent a major advance over traditional capture--recapture (CR) models because they yield explicit estimates of animal density instead of population size within an unknown area. Furthermore, unlike nonspatial CR methods, SCR models account for heterogeneity in capture probability arising from the juxtaposition of animal activity centers and sample locations. Although the utility of SCR methods is gaining recognition, the requirement that all individuals can be uniquely identified excludes their use in many contexts. In this paper, we develop models for situations in which individual recognition is not possible, thereby allowing SCR concepts to be applied in studies of unmarked or partially marked populations. The data required for our model are spatially referenced counts made on one or more sample occasions at a collection of closely spaced sample units such that individuals can be encountered at multiple locations. Our approach includes a spatial point process for the animal activity centers and uses the spatial correlation in counts as information about the number and location of the activity centers. Camera-traps, hair snares, track plates, sound recordings, and even point counts can yield spatially correlated count data, and thus our model is widely applicable. A simulation study demonstrated that while the posterior mean exhibits frequentist bias on the order of 5--10\% in small samples, the posterior mode is an accurate point estimator as long as adequate spatial correlation is present. Marking a subset of the population substantially increases posterior precision and is recommended whenever possible. We applied our model to avian point count data collected on an unmarked population of the northern parula (Parula americana) and obtained a density estimate (posterior mode) of 0.38 (95\% CI: 0.19--1.64) birds/ha. Our paper challenges sampling and analytical conventions in ecology by demonstrating that neither spatial independence nor individual recognition is needed to estimate population density---rather, spatial dependence can be informative about individual distribution and density.",

As carnivores may function close to maximum sustained power outputs, decreased food availability or increased activity may render some populations energetically vulnerable. Prey theft may compromise energetic budgets of mesopredators, such as cheetahs and wild dogs, which are susceptible to competition from larger carnivores. We show that daily energy expenditure (DEE) of cheetahs was similar to size-based predictions and positively related to distance traveled. Theft at 25\% only requires cheetahs to hunt for an extra 1.1 hour per day, increasing DEE by just 12\%. Therefore, not all mesopredators are energetically constrained by direct competition. Other factors that increase DEE, such as those that increase travel, may be more important for population viability.",

	abstract = "If habitat destruction or overexploitation of populations is severe, species loss can occur directly and abruptly. Yet the final descent to extinction is often driven by synergistic processes (amplifying feedbacks) that can be disconnected from the original cause of decline. We review recent observational, experimental and meta-analytic work which together show that owing to interacting and self-reinforcing processes, estimates of extinction risk for most species are more severe than previously recognised. As such, conservation actions which only target single-threat drivers risk being inadequate because of the cascading effects caused by unmanaged synergies. Future work should focus on how climate change will interact with and accelerate ongoing threats to biodiversity, such as habitat degradation, overexploitation and invasive species. Allee effect: a decline in individual fitness at low population size or density [34]. Background extinction: extinction that normally occurs because of gradual environmental change, newly established competitive interactions (by evolu- tion or invasion) and occasional chance calamities. Coextinction: extinction of a species triggers the loss of another mutualistic species. Declining population paradigm: the identification and management of the processes that depress the demographic rate of a species and cause its populations to decline deterministically [4]. Ecological chaos: nonlinear deterministic variation in the abundance of a population over time. Ecosystem services: products (e.g. timber) and services (e.g. flood control) provided by the assemblage of species in an ecosystem. Evil quartet: the four principal causes of modern extinctions are (i) habitat loss, (ii) introduced species, (iii) extinction cascades (chains of extinctions) and (iv) overexploitation [14]. Extinction debt: extinction of species or populations occurring long after the causative perturbation. Extinction vortex: as populations decline, a mutual reinforcement occurs among biotic and abiotic processes that drives population size downward to extinction. Extirpation: extinction of a local population, rather than of an entire species. Minimum viable population (MVP): the number of individuals in a population required to have a specified probability of persistence over a given period of time. Usually, a 99\% probability of persisting for 100 years (or 40 generations) is used. Small population paradigm: the study of the dynamics of small populations that have declined owing to some (deterministic) perturbation and which are more susceptible to extinction via chance (stochastic) events [4]. Synergistic processes: various perturbations can interact positively to increase the extinction risk of a species. For example, habitat loss might increase the vulnerability of some species to global warming by further stressing their physiological tolerance and making range shifts impossible (Figure 1). Trophic cascade: a reciprocal predator--prey effect which alters the abundance or productivity of a population, community or trophic level across multiple links in a food web.",

Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective.

	abstract = "Ecosystem stability in variable environments depends on the diversity of form and function of the constituent species. Species phenotypes and ecologies are the product of evolution, and the evolutionary history represented by co-occurring species has been shown to be an important predictor of ecosystem function. If phylogenetic distance is a surrogate for ecological differences, then greater evolutionary diversity should buffer ecosystems against environmental variation and result in greater ecosystem stability. We calculated both abundance-weighted and unweighted phylogenetic measures of plant community diversity for a long-term biodiversity--ecosystem function experiment at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, USA. We calculated a detrended measure of stability in aboveground biomass production in experimental plots and showed that phylogenetic relatedness explained variation in stability. Our results indicate that communities where species are evenly and distantly related to one another are more stable compared to communities where phylogenetic relationships are more clumped. This result could be explained by a phylogenetic sampling effect, where some lineages show greater stability in productivity compared to other lineages, and greater evolutionary distances reduce the chance of sampling only unstable groups. However, we failed to find evidence for similar stabilities among closely related species. Alternatively, we found evidence that plot biomass variance declined with increasing phylogenetic distances, and greater evolutionary distances may represent species that are ecologically different (phylogenetic complementarity). Accounting for evolutionary relationships can reveal how diversity in form and function may affect stability. cf Kennedy et al 2002.",

According to the dominant paradigm in the environmental sciences, ecological impact is a function of consumption, as captured by the IPAT formula (Impact = Population × Affluence × Technology) introduced by Ehrlich and Holdren (3--5), but it lacks a variable that captures the condition of ecosystems. The inverse relationship between resource richness and ecological impact shows in human efforts to meet oil demand. As oil fields decline, more effort must be expended to maintain production.",

	abstract = "Assessing temporal changes in species extinction risk is necessary for measuring conservation success or failure and for directing conservation resources toward species or regions that would benefit most. Yet, there is no long-term picture of genuine change that allows one to associate species extinction risk trends with drivers of change or conservation actions. Through a review of 40 years of IUCN-related literature sources on species conservation status (e.g., action plans, red-data books), we assigned retrospective red-list categories to the world{\rq}s carnivores and ungulates (2 groups with relatively long generation times) to examine how their extinction risk has changed since the 1970s. We then aggregated species{\rq} categories to calculate a global trend in their extinction risk over time. A decline in the conservation status of carnivores and ungulates was underway 40 years ago and has since accelerated. One quarter of all species (n = 498) moved one or more categories closer to extinction globally, while almost half of the species moved closer to extinction in Southeast Asia. The conservation status of some species improved (toward less threatened categories), but for each species that improved in status 8 deteriorated. The status of large-bodied species, particularly those above 100 kg (including many iconic taxa), deteriorated significantly more than small-bodied species (below 10 kg). The trends we found are likely related to geopolitical events (such as the collapse of Soviet Union), international regulations (such as CITES), shifting cultural values, and natural resource exploitation (e.g., in Southeast Asia). Retrospective assessments of global species extinction risk reduce the risk of a shifting baseline syndrome, which can affect decisions on the desirable conservation status of species. Such assessments can help conservationists identify which conservation policies and strategies are or are not helping safeguard biodiversity and thus can improve future strategies.

We conducted 262 semi-structured interviews with villagers around Tanzania{\rq}s Ruaha National Park. The surveys provided data on respondents{\rq} perceived problems with wildlife, knowledge, reported killing of carnivores, and their socio-economic characteristics. 98.5\% of people perceived a problem with wildlife, and respondents viewed large carnivores as significantly more problematic than other species, due to the threats they posed to livestock and humans. Despite this, only 7.3\% of people admitted to having killed any large carnivores. Depredation was widespread, having affected 61.1\% of households, but was less important than other forms of stock loss -- monthly recall data revealed 1.2\% of stock were predated, compared to 9.1\% lost to disease and 2.8\% to theft. Although experience of depredation significantly predicted negative attitudes towards carnivores, it was not the most important factor. The study raises the possibility of {\lq}contagious conflict{\rq}, where perceived problems with one group of species were strongly associated with perceived problems with others. Furthermore, factors such as ethnic group and religious beliefs were significant predictors of perceived problems.

Fresh water makes up only 0.01\% of the World{\rq}s water and approximately 0.8 \% of the Earth{\rq}s surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100 000 species out of approximately 1.8 million -- almost 6 \% of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the {\lq} Water for Life {\rq} decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it ? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings : overexploitation ; water pollution ; flow modification ; destruction or degradation of habitat ; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as {\lq} receivers {\rq} of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and -- in the case of migrating aquatic fauna -- downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management -- one that has been appropriately termed {\lq} reconciliation ecology {\rq}.

	abstract = "Although detailed, long-term scientific studies provide potentially crucial information for conservation, they are rare. Moreover, there is often a disjunction between scientists and managers that can affect whether scientific results are applied to help solve conservation problems. Long-term studies can promote increased communication between scientists and managers and hence offer an opportunity for constructive engagement between the two groups. We examined direct and indirect impacts of a 30-year study, the Serengeti Cheetah Project (SCP). Much of what is currently known about wild cheetahs comes from the SCP. In particular, the SCP has demonstrated that cheetahs have a combination of semisociality and ranging patterns that is unique among mammals. This system arises because cheetahs need to be mobile to avoid predators and competitors, yet maintain access to prey; this results in densities much lower than for other large carnivores and a requirement for large areas of heterogenous and connected habitat. The SCP started as a research project, but expanded into a national program, developing capacity for carnivore conservation within Tanzania. Long-term studies such as the SCP are uniquely placed to establish effective working relationships between scientists and managers, engage local and national institutions, and strengthen national capacity for biodiversity conservation. This process is best realized through the establishment of frameworks for conservation that seek to align scientific research with management needs. Long-term studies also play an important role in identifying international priorities for conservation. Nonetheless, the integration of science and management in conservation is a two-way process that requires concerted efforts by both sides to improve and maintain dialogue. Ultimately, conservation depends on people, and maintaining a commitment to a particular area over many years---such as through implementation of a long-term research project---helps establish mutual trust and respect, particularly when combined with development of local and national capacity for scientific research and conservation management.

This paper describes a new and general method for estimating density from closed-population capture-recapture data. Many estimators exist for the size (N) and mean capture probability (p\={ }) of a closed population. These statistics suffer from an unknown bias due to edge effect that varies with trap layout and home range size. The mean distance between successive captures of an individual (d\={ }) provides information on the scale of individual movements, but is itself a function of trap spacing and grid size. Our aim is to define and estimate parameters that do not depend on the trap layout. In the new method, simulation and inverse prediction are used to estimate jointly the population density (D) and two parameters of individual capture probability, magnitude (g�fi�) and spatial scale (sigma), from the information in {\~N} p\={ } and d\={ }. The method uses any configuration of traps (e.g. grid, web or line) and any choice of closed-population estimator. It is assumed that home ranges have a stationary distribution in two dimensions, and that capture events may be simulated as the outcome of competing Poisson processes in time. The method is applied to simulated and field data. The estimator appears unusually robust and free from bias.",

We therefore decided to fund a second, updated and completely revised edition. Namibia, as one of the most progressive countries in the so-called {\lq}Third World{\rq} has a remarkable record when it comes to the protection of the environment. There is always a conflict between protection of the environment and economic development in developing countries. In the case of Namibia the challenges are an unemployment rate of more than 30 percent, mining as the key economic activity, a very fragile environment and the effects of climate change. The Namibian Government tries to find ways to address these divergent challenges. The country{\rq}s Environmental Management Act of 2007 is considered a model legislative initiative, not only in an African context, especially for a developing country. With this law Namibia acknowledges its responsibility to protect and maintain its environmental and natural resources for future generations, who should not be adversely affected as a result of the actions of currents generations. The country has committed itself to the UN{\rq}s Millennium Development Goals, has its Vision 2030 and every four years a new National Development Plan is initiated, the current one being NDP4 which was unveiled in July 2012. All three programmes are geared towards socio-economic development, even in the face of very severe challenges and concerns. Most prominent amongst these concerns are the environment, climate change and the country{\rq}s almost total dependence on international markets, which means Namibia is competing against countries that do not subscribe to or uphold environmental awareness and protection standards to the same level. The first edition of this book was greeted with a remarkable international and national response. This encouraged us to fund the second edition of Environmental Law and Policy in Namibia. Dr Katharina Ruppel-Schlichting and Professor Oliver C. Ruppel engaged a distinguished group of authors, whose contributions have been invaluable to the efforts of continual upgrade and improvement of this book. The Hanns Seidel Foundation for some decades now, as part of its worldwide activities, supports the protection of the natural environment as it relates to and intersects with political, economic and social development, in recognition that environmental protection has become a major global challenge against the backdrop of increased demand for universal socio-economic upliftment. In this regard, we are aware of the competing priorities of rendering sustainable development and protecting the environment. The Hanns Seidel Foundation therefore wants to contribute to finding solutions to overcome the new challenges. Limited human resources and funds, weak institutions and lack of understanding of the responsibility towards future generations exacerbate already strained conditions in the developing world, limiting the ability of these countries to meet new challenges proactively. Against this backdrop, we view our assistance as an important part of our good governance programmes.",

R is an environment incorporating an implementation of the S programming language, which is powerful, flexible and has excellent graphical facilities (R Development Core Team, 2005). In the Handbook we aim to give relatively brief and straightforward descriptions of how to conduct a range of statistical analyses using R. Each chapter deals with the analysis appropriate for one or several data sets. A brief account of the relevant statistical background is included in each chapter along with appropriate references, but our prime focus is on how to use R and how to interpret results. We hope the book will provide students and researchers in many disciplines with a self-contained means of using R to analyse their data. R is an open-source project developed by dozens of volunteers for more than ten years now and is available from the Internet under the General Public Licence. R has become the lingua franca of statistical computing. Increasingly, implementations of new statistical methodology first appear as R add-on packages. In some communities, such as in bioinformatics, R already is the primary workhorse for statistical analyses. Because the sources of the R system are open and available to everyone without restrictions and because of its powerful language and graphical capabilities, R has started to become the main computing engine for reproducible statistical research (Leisch, 2002a,b, 2003, Leisch and Rossini, 2003, Gentleman, 2005). For a reproducible piece of research, the original observations, all data preprocessing steps, the statistical analysis as well as the scientific report form a unity and all need to be available for inspection, reproduction and modification by the readers. Reproducibility is a natural requirement for textbooks such as the {\lq}Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R{\rq} and therefore this book is fully reproducible using an R version greater or equal to 2.4.0.

Our MSHC rule provides estimates within 12\% of true area values for all 5 data sets, while kernel methods are worse in all cases: in one case overestimating area by a factor of 10 and in another case underestimating area by a factor of 50. Our method also constructs much better estimates for the density isopleths of the UDs than kernel methods. The a-hull method does not lead directly to the construction of isopleths and also does not always include all points in the constructed home range.

We found evidence for pathogen dilution, whereby disease risk was lower in sites with higher species diversity, after accounting for potentially confounding effects of host density and landscape heterogeneity.

Yet conservation managers have no way of knowing the carrying capacity of their reserves. Here we derived relationships between the preferred prey (species and weight range) of Africa{\rq}s large predator guild and their population densities to predict their carrying capacity in ten South African conservation areas. Conservation managers intervened at several of these sites because of evidence of predator overpopulation and these provided independent tests of our predictions. Highly significant linear relationships were found between the biomass of the preferred prey species of lion, leopard, spotted hyaena and African wild dog, and the biomass of prey in the preferred weight range of cheetah. These relationships are more robust than previous work for lion, cheetah and leopard, and novel for spotted hyaena and African wild dog. These relationships predicted that several predators exceeded carrying capacity at four sites, two where managers expressed concerns about overpopulation due to a decline in wildlife abundance and two where carnivores were actively removed. The ability to predict the carrying capacity of large predators is fundamental to their conservation, particularly in small enclosed reserves. Every predator that preys on large, readily surveyed wildlife can have its carrying capacity predicted in this manner based on the abundance of its preferred prey. This will be beneficial for reintroduction attempts, threatened species management, overpopulation estimation, detecting poaching and in investigating intra-guild competition.

Identification, conservation and restoration of tiger habitat will be a key component of recovering tiger numbers across Asia.

We conducted >28,000 km of winter snow tracking surveys in 2004/2005 over 266,000 km2 of potential tiger habitat in 970 sampling units (~171 km2) to record the presence of tracks of tigers and their ungulate prey. We adopted a used-unused design to estimate Resource Selection Probability Functions (RSPF) for tigers, red deer, roe deer, sika deer, wild boar, musk deer and moose. Tiger habitat was best predicted by a niche-based RSPF model based on biotic interactions with red deer, sika deer and wild boar, as well as avoidance of areas of high human activity and road density. We identified 155,000 km2 of occupied tiger habitat in the RFE in 17 main habitat patches. Degradation of tiger habitat was most extreme in the southern areas of the Russian Far East, where at least 42\% of potential historic tiger habitat has been destroyed. To improve and restore tiger habitat, aggressive conservation efforts to reduce human impacts and increase ungulate densities, tiger reproduction and adult survival will be needed across all tiger habitat identified by our tiger habitat model.",

	abstract = "In 1997, at the 10th meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Conference of the Parties (CoP), the Parties resolved to establish a monitoring programme across the entire range of the African and Asian elephants [Resolution Conf. 10.10]. It was intended that this programme would facilitate decision-making by the Parties regarding the protected status of elephants. It was also the first attempt to provide a systematic and detailed assessment of the impact of the Parties{\rq} decisions to allow, restrict, or suspend trade in a particular species (and/or its parts and derivatives). The Monitoring the Illegal Killing Of Elephants programme, now known by its acronym, MIKE, was endorsed at the 41st meeting of the CITES Standing Committee in February 1999. The MIKE programme plans to achieve these objectives through a site-based system of collecting data on elephant population trends, the incidence and patterns of illegal killing, and the effort and resources employed in detecting and preventing illegal hunting and trade. The MIKE programme is also charged with developing and using a standardized methodology for data collection and analysis. Much of the elephant population monitoring under this initiative involves dung-count based surveys in forest sites to obtain estimates of elephant population size. These surveys will be repeated over time to detect changes in elephant numbers at the selected sites. In order that this monitoring be done as effectively as possible, MIKE survey teams must use standardized defensible methods that are capable of producing accurate and precise results, and which are comparable over all sites and remain comparable over time within sites. Arising from this is a need for a set of standards to ensure the quality and comparability of the programme{\rq}s survey results. This document was commissioned by the MIKE programme to set those standards for dung count based population surveys. Specifically, these Dung Count Population Survey Standards are the product of a task force that was set up by the MIKE programme with the objective of writing these standards. The MIKE Dung Survey Task force met in October 2003 to decide on an appropriate dung count based survey method, suggest a standardized protocol for this method, and review practical problems faced by dung counts and other survey techniques in forests.",

Bruskotter argue that when examining reasons for intolerance of and intention to kill predators, social factors (such as peer group norms and government-sanctioned predator killings) are more important than conventionally held views (such as measured or perceived threats to livelihoods). The authors use case studies on jaguars, wolves, lions, and bears to convincingly support their argument. With increased anthropogenic disturbance, species not traditionally viewed as predatory may respond increasingly aggressively toward people. Although attacks are rare, concerns about sharing landscapes with great apes may be motivated more by fear of physical aggression than other more common causes of provocation such as threats to livelihoods (i.e., crop damage). As with carnivores, tolerance by local people toward these large-bodied mammals is affected by deep-rooted social beliefs that can influence outcomes, including retaliatory killings. People{\rq}s tolerance of wildlife can change quickly in response to shifting economic, demographic, and political conditions. To understand the potential for sustainable human-wildlife coexistence, human social change must be considered alongside changing wildlife behavior in response to human activities and across contexts (such as crop feeding, livestock depredation, and attacks on people) and species. To disentangle such complexities, conservation science must encourage collaborations between social and biological scientists.",

A virtue of the rank procedure is that it provides comparable results whether a questionable component is included or excluded from consideration. Statistical tests of significance are given for the method. The paper also offers a hierarchical ordering of selection processes.

In 2014, the RIS celebrated its 50th anniversary. This paper marks that achievement with an extensive spatiotemporal analysis and the provision of the first British annotated checklist of aphids since 1964. 2. Our main aim was to elucidate mechanisms that advance aphid phenology under climate change and explain these using life-history traits. We then highlight emerging pests using accumulation patterns. 3. Linear and nonlinear mixed-effect models estimated the average rate of change per annum and effects of climate on annual counts, first and last flights and length of flight season since 1965. Two climate drivers were used: the accumulated day degrees above 16 °C (ADD16) indicated the potential for migration during the aphid season; the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) signalled the severity of the winter before migration took place. 4. All 55 species studied had earlier first flight trends at rate of b = 0+-611 SE 0-015 days year 1. Of these species, 49\% had earlier last flights, but the average species effect appeared relatively stationary (b = 0+-010 SE 0-022 days year 1). Most species (85\%) showed increasing duration of their flight season (b = 0+-336 SE 0-026 days year 1), even though only 54\% increased their log annual count (b = 0+-002 SE <0-001 year 1). 5. The ADD16 and NAO were shown to drive patterns in aphid phenology in a spatiotemporal context. Early in the year when the first aphids were migrating, the effect of the winter NAO was highly significant. Further into the year, ADD16 was a strong predictor. Latitude had a near linear effect on first flights, whereas longitude produced a generally less-clear effect on all responses. Aphids that are anholocyclic (permanently parthenogenetic) or are monoecious (non-host-alternating) were advancing their phenology faster than those that were not. 6. Climate drives phenology and traits help explain how this takes place biologically. Phenology and trait ecology are critical to understanding the threat posed by emerging pests such as Myzus persicae nicotianae and Aphis fabae cirsiiacanthoidis, as revealed by the species accumulation analysis.",

These have had mixed success due to a number of factors, including a lack of shared understanding of the problem and how to monitor and evaluate effectiveness. The long history of damage-causing animals (DCAs) which exit the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, inflicting damage on persons and property, increasing risk of disease transfer between wildlife and livestock, and seriously undermining the livelihoods of local communities, remains a contentious issue. As a partial response and within a strategic adaptive management framework, the park and its larger governing body, SANParks, have negotiated a wildlife damage compensation scheme with local communities, which entails financial retribution given to farmers who have previously lost livestock to DCAs originating from the park. A corollary scheme will see compensation paid to valid claims commencing from 2014. Here we present findings of a novel study undertaken with KNP staff, livestock farmers, and others to co-identify potential indicators of an objective-based participatory monitoring and evaluation program for the scheme. Based on a multi-method approach, a wide array of goals and objectives were articulated for the scheme. In addition, 88 program indicators were generated as potential measures to monitor change.

Wildlife professionals could reduce the controversy surrounding wolves by 1) clearly delineating policy decisions from the scientific input used to inform these decisions; 2) clearly articulating scientific concepts when they are used in agency communications; 3) employing collaborative public-involvement processes designed to reduce conflicts (e.g., collaborative learning, alternative dispute resolution); and 4) setting hunting and trapping regulations with public input concerning the timing of seasons, and methods and locations of take. Longitudinal studies designed to assess how human attitudes and behaviors change in response to changing policies would be particularly valuable for understanding and potentially reducing conflicts over wolves (and other wildlife) in the future.

	abstract = "1. Reliable assessment of animal populations is a long-standing challenge in wildlife ecology. Technological advances have led to widespread adoption of camera traps (CTs) to survey wildlife distribution, abundance and behaviour. As for any wildlife survey method, camera trapping must contend with sources of sampling error such as imperfect detection. Early applications focused on density estimation of naturally marked species, but there is growing interest in broad-scale CT surveys of unmarked populations and communities. Nevertheless, inferences based on detection indices are controversial, and the suitability of alternatives such as occupancy estimation is debatable. 2. We reviewed 266 CT studies published between 2008 and 2013. We recorded study objectives and methodologies, evaluating the consistency of CT protocols and sampling designs, the extent to which CT surveys considered sampling error, and the linkages between analytical assumptions and species ecology. 3. Nearly two-thirds of studies surveyed more than one species, and a majority used response variables that ignored imperfect detection (e.g. presence--absence, relative abundance). Many studies used opportunistic sampling and did not explicitly report details of sampling design and camera deployment that could affect conclusions. 4. Most studies estimating density used capture--recapture methods on marked species, with spatially explicit methods becoming more prominent. Few studies estimated density for unmarked species, focusing instead on occupancy modelling or measures of relative abundance. While occupancy studies estimated detectability, most did not explicitly define key components of the modelling framework (e.g. a site) or discuss potential violations of model assumptions (e.g. site closure). Studies using relative abundance relied on assumptions of equal detectability, and most did not explicitly define expected relationships between measured responses and underlying ecological processes (e.g. animal abundance and movement). 5. Synthesis and applications. The rapid adoption of camera traps represents an exciting transition in wildlife survey methodology. We remain optimistic about the technology{\rq}s promise, but call for more explicit consideration of underlying processes of animal abundance, movement and detection by cameras, including more thorough reporting of methodological details and assumptions. Such transparency will facilitate efforts to evaluate and improve the reliability of camera trap surveys, ultimately leading to stronger inferences and helping to meet modern needs for effective ecological inquiry and biodiversity monitoring.

	abstract = "Parametric kernel methods currently dominate the literature regarding the construction of animal home ranges (HRs) and utilization distributions (UDs). These methods frequently fail to capture the kinds of hard boundaries common to many natural systems. Recently a local convex hull (LoCoH) nonparametric kernel method, which generalizes the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method, was shown to be more appropriate than parametric kernel methods for constructing HRs and UDs, because of its ability to identify hard boundaries (e.g., rivers, cliff edges) and convergence to the true distribution as sample size increases. Here we extend the LoCoH in two ways: {\lq}{\lq}fixed sphere-of-influence,{\rq}{\rq} or r-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a fixed radius r of each reference point), and an {\lq}{\lq}adaptive sphere-of-influence,{\rq}{\rq} or a-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a radius a such that the distances of all points within the radius to the reference point sum to a value less than or equal to a), and compare them to the original {\lq}{\lq}fixed-number-of-points,{\rq}{\rq} or k-LoCoH (all kernels constructed from k-1 nearest neighbors of root points). We also compare these nonparametric LoCoH to parametric kernel methods using manufactured data and data collected from GPS collars on African buffalo in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results demonstrate that LoCoH methods are superior to parametric kernel methods in estimating areas used by animals, excluding unused areas (holes) and, generally, in constructing UDs and HRs arising from the movement of animals influenced by hard boundaries and irregular structures (e.g., rocky outcrops). We also demonstrate that a-LoCoH is generally superior to k- and r-LoCoH (with software for all three methods available at http://locoh.cnr.berkeley.edu).",

Having made this connection between the Enlightenment and Christianity, however, Siedentop proceeds to confuse the two, thereby falling into one of the errors I warn against below. According to him, the symbiosis of a moderate Enlightenment and a modernized Christianity is a progressive, melioristic liberal outlook, one that seeks to ``influence political and social outcomes'' in the name of a vaguely religious humanitarianism, or a ``social gospel.`` Such a humanitarianism is not a symbiosis of religion and secularity, but secularity with a religious veneer.",

Key advantages are the monitoring of (1) elusive species, (2) different taxa simultaneously, (3) large temporal and spatial scales, (4) with reduced human presence and (5) with considerable time saving for data processing. However, terrestrial sound environments can be highly complex; they are very challenging when trying to automatically detect and classify vocalizations because of low signal-to-noise ratios. Therefore, most studies have used manual preselection of high-quality sounds to achieve better classification rates. Consequently, most systems have never been validated under realistic field conditions. 2. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a passive acoustic monitoring system for four primate species in the highly noisy rain forest environment of the Taï National Park, C{\^o}te d{\rq}Ivoire. We collected 12 851 h of recordings with 20 autonomous recording units and did not preselect high-quality sounds manually. To automatically detect and classify the sounds of interest, we used an automated system built on speaker segmentation, support vector machines and Gaussian mixture models. One hundred and seventy-nine hours of recordings were used for validating the system. 3. The system performed well in detecting the loud calls of Cercopithecus diana and Colobus polykomos with a recall of 50\% and 42\%, respectively. Recall rates were lower for Pan troglodytes and Procolobus badius. To determine the presence of Cercopithecus diana and Colobus polykomos with a certainty of P > 0.999, 2 and 7 h of recordings were needed, respectively. For these two species, our automated approach reflected the spatio-temporal distribution of vocalization events well. Despite the seemingly low precision, time investment for the manual removal of false positives in the system{\rq}s output was only 3.5\% compared to a human collecting and processing the primate vocalization data. 4. The proposed monitoring system is already fully applicable for Cercopithecus diana and Colobus polykomos, whereas it needs further improvement for the other species tested. In principle, it can be applied to any distinctive animal sound and can be implemented for the collection of acoustic data for behavioural, ecological and conservation studies.",

Kamler, unpublished data). In general, black-backed jackals feed primarily on small-sized prey, ranging in size from insects and small rodents, up to small (<=15 kg) antelope species (Stuart \& Stuart, 2001; Skinner \& Chimimba, 2005). Although black-backed jackals were observed to prey upon the fawns of large ungulate species, especially gazelles (Gazella spp.; Estes, 1967; Wyman, 1967; van Lawick \& van Lawick-Goodall, 1970; Kruuk, 1972), predation on adult large ungulates were rarely observed. A review of the literature showed that black-backed jackals successfully hunted adult gazelles (Schaller, 1972; Sleicher, 1973; Lamprecht, 1978; Moehlman, 1983), adult impala (Aepyceros melampus Lichtenstein; McKenzie, 1990), and adult springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis Zimmermann; Krofel, 2008). In all cases, several jackals were involved in killing the ungulate, as body mass of adult ungulates were more than threefold larger than individual jackals. In fact, adult jackals were reported to leave their territories to form temporary groups to hunt adult impala in Botswana (McKenzie, 1990). However, McKenzie (1990) concluded that hunting of adults might have been an exception, because most impala killed were of relatively old age due to the absence or low numbers of larger carnivores which might normally prey upon them. Hence, the purpose of this note is to report the first observation of a single black-backed jackal chasing and killing an apparently healthy adult impala.",

Sheep comprised 25--48\% of the biomass consumed by jackals across seasons, and consumption peaked during the lambing seasons, indicating sheep often were the main food resource for jackals. Another main food resource was wild ungulates <50 kg, primarily springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) and steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), which comprised 8--47\% of the biomass consumed. Other important food items were mammals 1--3 kg (4--16\%), which included hares (Lepus spp.) and springhares (Pedetes capensis), and small rodents (10--14\%). Compared to the biomass available, jackals selectively consumed mammals 1--3 kg over sheep across all seasons, whereas wild ungulates <50 kg were selectively consumed over sheep in most seasons. Our results showed that jackals selectively consumed different food items throughout the year and that wild prey were consistently selected over sheep.",

From 2005 to 2008, we captured, radio-collared, and monitored 11 cape foxes, 22 bat-eared foxes, and 15 black-backed jackals on a game ranch in South Africa to investigate their spatial, habitat, temporal, and dietary resource overlap. Mean annual home-range sizes were 27.7 km2 for cape foxes, 5.0 km2 for bat-eared foxes, and 17.8 km2 for jackal family groups. Home ranges overlapped completely between species, although core areas overlapped less (<45\%), with cape foxes and jackals overlapping the least (12\%). When active, cape foxes, but not bat-eared foxes, used core areas of jackal groups less than expected. Additionally, both fox species used jackal core areas less than expected for their den sites, suggesting areas outside jackal core areas were used as refuges by foxes. Strong levels of habitat partitioning were not apparent at the study site or home-range levels, although habitat selection for den sites differed between jackals and cape foxes. Jackals were the most diurnal across seasons, whereas cape foxes were the most nocturnal. Diets overlapped little (R0 1�fi�4 0.20--0.34) among the canid species, with bat-eared foxes overlapping the least with the others. Jackals killed at least 5 collared bat-eared foxes and 1 collared cape fox, indicating potential interference competition, probably for exclusive use of territorial space rather than over shared resources. We conclude that bat-eared foxes coexisted with jackals primarily by their dietary specialization and group living. Cape foxes coexisted with jackals by exhibiting high levels of spatial, habitat, temporal, and dietary partitioning. Surprisingly, the fox species exhibited positive associations with each other. Our results show the mechanisms that may allow jackals to suppress fox populations, yet also show how foxes, in turn, use different mechanisms to coexist with a dominant canid..

We investigated the ecology of cape foxes (Vulpes chama) and bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis) in the absence of black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas), a dominant mesocarnivore and predator of both fox species. Results were compared with a concurrent study that investigated the ecology of both fox species in the presence of jackals, at a site ,5 km away. In the absence of jackals, densities of cape foxes increased 64\% despite similar food and habitat resources between sites, indicating that jackals suppressed cape fox populations. In contrast, jackals did not suppress populations of bat-eared foxes. For both fox species, the absence of jackals resulted in smaller home-range sizes and nonselective use of habitats for den sites, indicating that jackals had sublethal effects on the ecology and behavior of both fox species. Additionally, in the absence of jackals, cape foxes were marginally more active during daytime, whereas bat-eared foxes exhibited smaller group sizes. The 2 fox species became more segregated in the absence of jackals, indicating that jackals also had sublethal effects on the interspecific relationships of fox species. Our results showed that the effects of a mesocarnivore can extend well beyond population suppression of small carnivores, although sublethal effects varied in intensity and often were species specific. Sublethal effects on small carnivores can occur even if population suppression by a mesocarnivore is not occurring.

Camera-traps were placed along regular travel routes of tigers to obtain 31 photographic 'captures' of individual tigers in a 15 km² study area, during nine sampling occasions. Tigers could be identified unambiguously from photographs, and capture histories of 10 different animals were obtained. The data were analysed in the conceptual framework of capture-recapture theory, using probabilistic models, The results suggest that the closed capture-recapture model M h which allows for heterogeneity of capture probabilities among individual animals was appropriate for estimating tiger population size. The mean tiger numbers and their 95\% confidence intervals were estimated at 11 (10-22) and 10 (10-15), respectively, with the Mh (Jackknife) and Mh (Chao) estima- tors. Considering the prey biomass available in the study area, the mean tiger densities of 13.3-14.7 adult/subadult tigers per 100 km 2 estimated from the above data appear to be reasonable.

	abstract = "The tiger (Panthera tigris) is an endangered, large felid whose demographic status is poorly known across its distributional range in Asia. Previously applied methods for estimating tiger abundance, using total counts based on tracks, have proved unreliable. Lack of reliable data on tiger densities not only has constrained our ability to understand the ecological factors shaping communities of large, solitary felids, but also has undermined the effective conservation of these animals. In this paper, we describe the use of a field method proposed by Karanth (1995), which combines camera-trap photography, to identify individual tigers, with theoretically well-founded capture--recapture models. We developed a sampling design for camera-trapping and used the approach to estimate tiger population size and density in four representative tiger habitats in different parts of India. The field method worked well and provided data suitable for analysis using closed capture--recapture models. The results suggest the potential for applying this methodology to rigorously estimate abundances, survival rates, and other population parameters for tigers and other low-density, secretive animal species in which individuals can be identified based on natural markings. Estimated probabilities of photo-capturing tigers present in the study sites ranged from 0.75 to 1.00. Estimated densities of tigers >1 yr old ranged from 4.1 +- 1.31 to 16.8 +- 2.96 tigers/100 km² (mean +- 1 SE ). Simultaneously, we used line-transect sampling to determine that mean densities of principal tiger prey at these sites ranged from 56.1 to 63.8 ungulates/km². Tiger densities appear to be positively associated with prey densities, except at one site influenced by tiger poaching. Our results generally support the prediction that relative abundances of large felid species may be governed primarily by the abundance and structure of their prey communities.

This involves the rather bold step of defining when people have been behaving unethically, and then providing suggestions on how they can avoid doing so in the future. To this end we have written, and tested on a group of authors, a guide for young researchers on the area of authorship, which many people agree is one of the more confused areas. But writing a document is one thing; disseminating it is another. We would therefore welcome comments, particularly on how we can use this report to change behaviour, so that it becomes not just another discussion document, but a real catalyst for change. In theory, authorship sounds straightforward, but in practice it often causes headaches. While preparing these guidelines, we heard about several cases. In one, a deserving junior researcher was omitted from the author list; in another a sponsoring company insisted on the inclusion of an opinion leader who had made virtually no contribution to a study. And the writer of a review article found her name replaced with that of her boss, because she was on maternity leave when the final version was submitted. Listing the authors tells readers who did the work and should ensure that the right people get the credit, and take responsibility, for the research. Although journal editors do not always agree among themselves on what constitutes authorship, many of them subscribe to the guidance from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), also known as the Vancouver group. The latest version, issued in 2001, states that:``Authorship credit should be based only on: (1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and (3) final approval of the version to be published.

Similarly, we have music theory that tells us that certain combinations of notes and chords work well together and other combinations don{\rq}t sound good.

@techreport{NAMMIC_2011,
	abstract = "The structure of the Namibian Beef Industry changed during the last years. The contribution of producer{\rq}s income from local slaughtering at export abattoirs declined, while local slaughtering for the local market and live exports grew. It is estimated that more than 400,000 head of cattle will be marketed in 2011 south of the veterinary cordon fence. 35\% of income of the primary cattle producers SVCF is derived from slaughtering at export abattoirs; 17\% from slaughtering for local consumption (both formal and informal); 41\% from live exports to South Africa, and 7\% from export from South of the Veterinary Cordon Fence (SVCF) to North of the Veterinary Cordon fence (NVCF). With a slaughter capacity of ±200,000 heads per year, it is clear that the live export market to RSA and the local slaughter market must be nurtured, and not negatively affected by non-tariff barriers and export restrictions. Similarly the structure of the Namibian sheep industry changed from mainly exporting live animals to South Africa, to slaughtering locally. This was due to direct Government intervention, with the result that small stock production declined. Government policy is clear what it wants to achieve in the Namibian Meat industry, with focus on increased livestock production, development of the livestock sector in the Northern Communal Areas (NCA) and increased value adding to primary products. The different policy statements (Vision 2030, NDP3, National Agricultural Policy, Namibia Agricultural Marketing and Trade Policy) is all having consensus about the above mentioned. The involvement and assistance of the livestock industry SVCF is of great importance to achieve this. Their current financial contribution and commitment to support the development of these areas must be communicated, coupled with concrete actions by the industry to assist the development of the NVCF. The intervention in the lamb \& sheep market by Government led to limited local value adding with virtually non-existent export of value added products to countries other than South Africa. Increased drought risk for historical small stock producing areas, which have converted to cattle production. Furthermore is it the opinion of industry experts that the main market for Namibian lamb will in future remain a whole carcass market, exported to the South African market. The costs to the industry as a whole outweigh the benefits of operating abattoirs locally. It is important for Government as custodian of the sheep marketing scheme to monitor the actual value adding which takes place in the slaughtering of sheep in Namibia. At the moment the lamb carcass is exported to the RSA market, and value adding is taking place outside the borders of Namibia. It is proposed that the emphasis should be placed on providing business incentives to local small stock abattoirs, instead of a penalty on the export of live sheep. The main goal of the sector strategy is to grow production on a national basis. This will only happen if the production system is profitable. Growth will not happen if an industry is penalised. The development of the African market for Namibian lamb and goat is an opportunity that needs to be exploited. Live cattle export is expected to increase with ±20\% to 200,000 in 2011, against the average live exports of 167,000 from 2006-2010. The main reason for this is the local weaner price as a \% of the carcass price (weaner: carcass ratio). This ratio is currently the highest in the last decade. Beef production systems where weaners are bought in the open market and grow out either extensively on veld, selling to export abattoirs is not as profitable as a weaner production system, or a cow/ox production system. The expectation is that this is going to change with the devaluation of the Rand and the increase in maize prices. The net income that a producer receives for slaughter cows was consistently higher at auctions, compared to slaughtering at export abattoirs, since the end of 2008. Producers are therefore expected to react on these marketing conditions and increase their female herd, selling more animals through auctions, and slaughter less female animals at export abattoirs. This will further reduce the competitiveness of export abattoirs as the slaughter cost/head increases further. Value chains competing with the local export abattoirs value chain became more competitive. South African feedlots vertically integrated and invested in further value adding into the full value chain, selling directly to retailers. Currently they are buying weaner calves on a contract basis directly from the producer in South Africa, and sell value added carcass cuts and processed meat directly to the retailer. They therefore have control over the full value chain. These companies also have scale benefits, as one of these companies (Karan Beef) is slaughtering double the number of animals that is slaughtered in total in Namibia. They are furthermore making use of the latest technology available to increase the efficiency of converting feed into beef carcass, as well as achieving cost savings across the value chain. The marketing strategy of Meatco changed significantly in the past years, with a much higher percentage of beef sold directly to retail customers than in the past. More benefits are therefore generated to the producer. Feeding weaners intensively in a feedlot is currently not profitable in Namibia. Namibia is a net importer of feed, and a net exporter of meat, which reduce the Beef:Maize ratio, and negatively impact on the profitability. The increasing impact of the predators is a major threat for small stock producers. This severely affects the profitability of the industry, and enhances the move from small stock to large stock in the traditional small stock areas. This increase the risk and impact of a drought in future in these areas. A NationalPredator Management must be develop and implemented to address this issue. Industry data is currently not comprehensive, which hampers the effectiveness of timely identification of change in industry trends. Information on especially the national livestock herd, the size of the local formal and informal market and the productivity of primary production must be addressed.",

	abstract = "The overall objective of the Joint Agri-Business and Department of Agriculture Forum for Africa (JADAFA) is to promote and develop mutually beneficial trade between South Africa and Namibia through enhanced agricultural and agro-industrial investments and partnerships. To that end, this brief aims to provide market intelligence on the Namibian livestock markets; in particular, the Beef, Poultry and Sheep markets. Agricultural market information in African markets is not always readily available. Namibia is no exception. According to the Namibian Livestock Sector Strategy report (2011), there remains a dearth in information particularly with regards to local (formal and informal) markets as well as financial information on local feedlots. Data from the FAO (2013) shows that most livestock numbers are increasing rapidly (see Table 1). According to the FAO (2013), Namibia recorded 2.35 million head of cattle, 2.85 million sheep, 70 000 pigs and 5.2 million chickens. Namibia is separated by a {\lq}red line{\rq} called the veterinary cordon fence (VCF) which divides the northern part of Namibia from the central and southern parts of the country. Although the red line has its origins from the country{\rq}s colonial roots, it is used as a disease control mechanism that isolates Foot and Mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks in the north from the farms in the south. The farms south of the red line are mainly white-owned commercial farmers whereas north of the red line farms are mostly black-owned. Farmers north of this line are not allowed sell livestock overseas and outside of South Africa whereas those in the south are allowed to sell their meat anywhere. Against this background, the export structure of the Namibian Livestock Industry sector numbers are structured as follows (Namibian Livestock Sector Strategy, 2011):  35\% of the primary beef producers South of the Veterinary Cordon Fence (SVCF) is derived from slaughtering at export abattoirs  7\% from export to North of the Veterinary Cordon fence (NVCF) from South of the Veterinary Cordon Fence (SVCF)  17\% from slaughtering for local consumption (both formal and informal);  41\% from live exports to South Africa Industry data on Namibia{\rq}s livestock sector is currently not comprehensive. This report gives an indication of the Namibian livestock industry trends in a snap-shot view of the sector. Information on especially the national livestock herd, the size of the local formal and informal market, and the productivity of primary production varies depending on source. In this report, official FAO and ITC Trade Map data are consulted to synthesise the available sectoral information.",

@techreport{Pilgrim_n_Ekstrom_2014,
	abstract = "We assess the conditions under which biodiversity offsets may: (i) provide the best outcomes for biodiversity; and (ii) achieve no net loss. Here, we consider {\lq}biodiversity offsets{\rq} as measurable conservation outcomes resulting from actions designed to compensate for significant residual adverse biodiversity impacts arising from project development after other appropriate prevention and mitigation measures have been taken (BBOP, 2012a). The goal of biodiversity offsets is to achieve no net loss (or net gain) in biodiversity. {\lq}No net loss{\rq} is a goal in which residual impacts on biodiversity (after other mitigation measures have been taken) do not exceed the gains from offsets. Importantly, no net loss has no universal definition: it can have varying definitions dependent on what biodiversity and human preferences are accounted for, and how they are accounted for. For example, no net loss goals may vary in terms of spatial scales, biodiversity that is included, or whether they include only {\lq}like-for-like{\rq} exchanges (e.g. replacing a hectare of house mouse habitat with a hectare of house mouse habitat) or also {\lq}trading up{\rq} (e.g. replacing a hectare of house mouse habitat with a hectare of panda habitat). From this report, we conclude that 20 main conditions are likely to be necessary to ensure offsets achieve their goal of no net loss: Facilitating conditions (i.e. existing policies and plans): 1. existing definition of societal biodiversity conservation goals (and preferably development goals) in policies and plans (e.g. national or provincial systematic conservation plans). Without pre-existing conservation goals, offset programmes and project-level voluntary offsets would best define such goals from first principles through a stakeholder consultation process, using available guidance (Section 5.1.1). 2. usually, adherence to the mitigation hierarchy: it will always be important to provide guidance on how -- and how far -- the mitigation hierarchy should be followed (Section 5.1.2). Scope and spatial scale: 3. inclusion of all biodiversity in a particular {\lq}no net loss{\rq} definition within the scope of offsetting (Section 5.2.1). 4. a match between the spatial scale of permitted offsetting and the spatial scale of a particular {\lq}no net loss{\rq} definition (Section 5.2.2). Metrics, currencies, and the ways in which they are exchanged: 5. currencies that include (or represent) all biodiversity within a particular {\lq}no net loss{\rq} definition, likely requiring a balance between simple/few and complex/numerous metrics, and multiple (species- and habitat-based) currencies (Section 5.2.3). 6. {\lq}like-for-like{\rq} or {\lq}like-for-like or better{\rq} exchanges (i.e. not trading down: Section 5.2.4). 7. disaggregation of, or minimum thresholds for, any metrics that are essential to a particular {\lq}no net loss{\rq} definition (Section 5.2.4). 8. limits on declines in relative condition/quality will be relevant on a case-by-case basis (Section 5.2.4). Limits to what can or should be offset: 9. definition of upper limits to what can or should be offset -- almost certainly by reference to systematic conservation plans based on clear conservation goals with specific targets (Section 5.2.5). 10. if they are defined, lower limits to what impacts can or should be offset must not exclude impacts/biodiversity which are included within the particular definition of {\lq}no net loss{\rq} being used in a given situation (Section 5.2.6). 11. guidance on relative offsetability (i.e. how appropriate or feasible offsets are between lower and upper limits) is not a pre-requisite for achievement of no net loss, but would be a significant factor in likelihood of success of no net loss programmes (Section 5.2.7). Additionality: 12. requirement for demonstration of clear additionality, plus methods such as credit adjustments (reductions) to cope with leakage where necessary (Section 5.2.8). Time considerations: assuring {\lq}permanence{\rq} and managing time lags{\rq}: 13. mechanisms to assure permanence in case of disasters (e.g. insurance, bonds), for long-term management (e.g. long-term financing mechanisms), and to secure land management rights (e.g. easements, convenants, protected area designation, retirement of sub-surface mineral rights) (Section 5.2.9). 14. where no net loss definitions include human time preference, avoidance or reduction of temporal loss through up-front habitat-/species-banking (or, for impacts of relatively low significance on secure biodiversity, multipliers). Otherwise, savings bank approaches are not a pre-requisite for, but would be a significant factor in increasing the likelihood of achieving, no net loss, in situations where they are practical (Section 5.2.10). Managing uncertainty and risk: 15. comprehensive identification of sources of uncertainty and risk, estimation of the scale of uncertainties, and estimation of the probability and consequences of risks (Section 5.2.12). 16. use of multipliers, insurance/bonds or production of offset gains before impacts to account for lack of precision (Sections 5.2.11, 5.2.12). 17. use of bet-hedging, insurance/bonds or production of offset gains before impacts to account for uncertainty over offset success (Section 5.2.12). 18. use of insurance/bonds to account for uncertainty over whether offset gains can be sustained (Sections 5.2.9, 5.2.12). Implementation: 19. sufficient capacity to review, implement, and monitor offsets, and to enforce regulations (Section 5.3.2). 20. stakeholder engagement during identification of scope, scale and location of offsetting, and in development of exchange rules (Section 5.3.4). Some additional conditions will promote optimal efficiency or optimal biodiversity outcomes from offsetting.",

Our analysis of gaps in high seas management indicates that a paradigm shift to a more systematic approach will be needed to safeguard high seas biodiversity from mounting threats. Experience from terrestrial and coastal areas indicates that a systematic approach to conservation planning and management can help to maintain ecosystem health and productivity while enabling sustainable use. Our analysis further demonstrates that the current legal regime on the high seas is insufficient to realize these objectives: management institutions have neither an adequate mandate for integrated planning nor the ability to effectively co-ordinate across multiple management regimes. We identify key elements for future high seas management and posit that a two-pronged approach is most promising: the development of an improved global legal regime that incorporates systematic planning as well as the expansion of existing and new regional agreements and mandates. This combined approach is most likely to achieve the required ecosystem-based, integrated and science-based management that world leaders at Rio acknowledged should underpin ocean management.",

Many of the species and ecosystems these plans were designed to conserve are now being affected by climate change, and there is a critical need to incorporate new and complementary approaches into these plans that will aid species and ecosystems in adjusting to potential climate change impacts. We propose five approaches to climate change adaptation that can be integrated into existing or new biodiversity conservation plans: (1) conserving the geophysical stage, (2) protecting climatic refugia, (3) enhancing regional connectivity, (4) sustaining ecosystem process and function, and (5) capitalizing on opportunities emerging in response to climate change. We discuss both key assumptions behind each approach and the trade-offs involved in using the approach for conservation planning. We also summarize additional data beyond those typically used in systematic conservation plans required to implement these approaches. A major strength of these approaches is that they are largely robust to the uncertainty in how climate impacts may manifest in any given region.",

However, research demonstrates important consequences of uncertainties in SCP and of basing methods on simplified circumstances involving few real-world complexities. Current research often relies on single case studies with unknown forms and amounts of uncertainty as well as low statistical power for generalizing results. Consequently, conservation managers have little evidence for the true performance of conservation planning methods in their own complex, uncertain applications. To build effective and reliable methods in SCP, there is a need for more challenging and integrated testing of their robustness to uncertainty and complexity, and much greater emphasis on generalization to real-world situations.",

	abstract = "Active and dynamic management of biodiversity is of utmost importance in the face of increasing human pressures on nature. Current approaches for site selection of protected areas often assume that both conservation features and management actions are fixed in space and time. However, this approach should be revised to allow for spatio-temporal shifts of biodiversity features, threats and management options. Our aim here was to demonstrate a novel approach for systematic conservation planning at a fine scale that incorporates dynamic ecological processes (e.g., succession), biodiversity targets and management costs. We used the new {\lq}Marxan with Zones{\rq} decision support tool to spatially redistribute the major structural types of vegetation within a privately-owned nature park in Israel and facilitate the achievement of multiple conservation targets for minimum cost. The park is located in the Mediterranean climate region of the eastern Mediterranean Basin, one of Earth{\rq}s richest biodiversity hotspots. This small park alone (4.5 km2) holds 660 species of native plants and six structural types of vegetation. The region has been subject to manifold human pressures such as grazing, clearing and fire for millennia and is currently threatened by a range of modern human-related activities (e.g., invasive alien species). By spatially redistributing the six structural vegetation types under three scenarios, representing different conservation objectives (no change, equal distribution -- evenness of structural types, preference to early succession stages) within three budget frameworks, we identified a set of near-optimal conservation strategies that can be enacted over time. The current spatial distribution of structural types and the cost of changing one structural type into another via management actions had a major impact on the spatial prioritization outcomes and management recommendations. Notably, an advanced successional stage (dense Mediterranean garrigue) tended to dominate a large portion of the landscape when the available budgets were low because it is a relatively inexpensive structural type to maintain. The approach presented here can be further applied to spatially prioritize conservation goals in the face of shifting environments and climates, allowing dynamic conservation planning at multiple spatial scales.

Climate change is poised to shift species distributions, reshuffle communities, and alter ecosystem functioning. In such a dynamic environment, lands selected to protect today{\rq}s biodiversity may fail to do so in the future. One proposed approach to designing reserve networks that are robust to climate change involves protecting the diversity of abiotic conditions that in part determine species distributions and ecological processes. A set of abiotically diverse areas will likely support a diversity of ecological systems both today and into the future, although those two sets of systems might be dramatically different. Here, we demonstrate a conservation planning approach based on representing unique combinations of abiotic factors. We prioritize sites that represent the diversity of soils, topographies, and current climates of the Columbia Plateau. We then compare these sites to sites prioritized to protect current biodiversity. This comparison highlights places that are important for protecting both today{\rq}s biodiversity and the diversity of abiotic factors that will likely determine biodiversity patterns in the future. It also highlights places where a reserve network designed solely to protect today{\rq}s biodiversity would fail to capture the diversity of abiotic conditions and where such a network could be augmented to be more robust to climate-change impacts.",

For a REDD+ program in Indonesian Borneo, we find that the most cost-effective way to reduce forest-based emissions by 25\% is to better manage protected areas and logging concessions. A more ambitious emissions reduction target would require constraining agricultural expansion and logging, which incurs opportunity costs. We discover, however, that these impacts can be mitigated by relocating oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) agricultural leases to areas that store, on average, 130 tons less carbon per hectare and are 8\% more productive for oil palm. This reduces the costs of meeting REDD+ targets, avoids conflict with agriculture, and has the unanticipated effect of minimizing impacts on logging. Our approach presents a transparent and defensible method for prioritizing REDD+ locations and strategies in a way that minimizes development trade-offs and promotes implementation success.

Predator-prey interactions are important when determining conservation and management strategies for predators. Seasonal variation in reproductive behaviour in terms of rutting and calving seasons can be observed for several African prey populations, and this variation is linked to rainfall patterns. Prey species are often more vulnerable to predation during the rut or the calving season.This study aims to determine the influence of calving and rutting seasons of five prey species on the prey selection of wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) and cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), and hypothesised that species in their calving or rutting season will be more susceptible to predation. Mortality data from Thanda Private Game Reserve, KwaZulu-Natal, was received from Wildlife ACT from 2006 to 2012 Prey preferences were determined. To determine the seasonality of prey selection, a correspondence analysis was conducted for the wild dogs and a cross-tabulation for the cheetahs.Clear seasonality could be seen for the wild dogs, with species in their calving or rutting seasons being hunted. No significant results were found for the cheetahs, and it seems that interspecific competition affected the cheetahs{\rq} prey selection.

	abstract = "The African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) and the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) present major challenges for conservationists in the 21st Century. Both species were formerly widely distributed in Africa, but both have experienced dramatic reductions in numbers and geographic range in recent decades (Ray, Hunter \&Zigouris, 2005). All large carnivores need large areas to survive; yet wild dogs and cheetahs range more widely, and hence need larger areas, than almost any other terrestrial carnivore species anywhere in the world. As human populations encroach on Africa{\rq}s last wild areas, wild dogs and cheetahs -- particularly susceptible to the destruction and fragmentation of habitat -- are often the first species to disappear. Despite their globally threatened status (wild dogs are listed as endangered and cheetahs as vulnerable (IUCN, 2006a)), their ecological importance as top carnivores (Woodroffe \& Ginsberg, 2005b), and their value to Africa{\rq}s tourism industry (Lindsey et al., 2007), to date remarkably little conservation action has been implemented for these two species. The majority of Africa{\rq}s protected areas are too small to conserve viable populations, and active conservation efforts on unprotected lands have hitherto been restricted to a handful of projects. Three factors have hindered conservation activity for cheetahs and wild dogs: 1. The species{\rq} massive area requirements mean that conservation planning is needed on a daunting spatial scale, rarely seen before in terrestrial conservation. 2. Information is lacking on the species{\rq} distribution and status, and on the tools most likely to achieve effective conservation. 3. Capacity to conserve these species is lacking in most African countries; expertise in managing more highprofile species such as elephants and rhinos may not be transferable to wild dogs or cheetahs because the threats and conservation challenges are likely to be different. Against this background, conservation issues associated with wild dogs and cheetahs are being addressed together because, despite being taxonomically quite different, the two species are ecologically very similar and hence face very similar threats.",

Equilibrium sensitivity, including slower surface albedo feedbacks, is ~6°C for doubled CO2 for the range of climate states between glacial conditions and ice-free Antarctica. Decreasing CO2 was the main cause of a cooling trend that began 50 million years ago, the planet being nearly ice-free until CO2 fell to 450 ± 100 ppm; barring prompt policy changes, that critical level will be passed, in the opposite direction, within decades. If humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm, but likely less than that. The largest uncertainty in the target arises from possible changes of non-CO2 forcings. An initial 350 ppm CO2 target may be achievable by phasing out coal use except where CO2 is captured and adopting agricultural and forestry practices that sequester carbon.

	abstract = "In many ways, managing a large computer programming project is like managing any other large undertaking---in more ways than most programmers believe. But in many other ways it is different---in more ways than most professional managers expect. The lore of the field is accumulating. There have been several conferences, sessions at AFIPS conferences, some books, and papers. But it is by no means yet in shape for any systematic textbook treatment. It seems appropriate, however, to offer this little book, reflecting essentially a personal view. Although I originally grew up in the programming side of computer science, I was involved chiefly in hardware architecture during the years (1956-1963) that the autonomous control program and the high-level language compiler were developed. When in 1964 I became manager of Operating System/360, I found a programming world quite changed by the progress of the previous few years. Managing OS/360 development was a very educational experience, albeit a very frustrating one. The team, including F. M. Trapnell who succeeded me as manager, has much to be proud of. The system contains many excellencies in design and execution, and it has been successful in achieving widespread use. Certain ideas, most noticeably device-independent input-output and external library management, were technical innovations now widely copied. It is now quite reliable, reasonably efficient, and very versatile. The effort cannot be called wholly successful, however. Any OS/360 user is quickly aware of how much better it should be. The flaws in design and execution pervade especially the control program, as distinguished from the language compilers. Most of these flaws date from the 1964-65 design period and hence must be laid to my charge. Furthermore, the product was late, it took more memory than planned, the costs were several times the estimate, and it did not perform very well until several releases after the first. After leaving IBM in 1965 to come to Chapel Hill as originally agreed when I took over OS/360, I began to analyze the OS/360 experience to see what management and technical lessons were to be learned. In particular, I wanted to explain the quite different management experiences encountered in System/ 360 hardware development and OS/360 software development. This book is a belated answer to Tom Watson's probing questions as to why programming is hard to manage. In this quest I have profited from long conversations with R. P. Case, assistant manager 1964-65, and F. M, Trapnell, manager 1965-68.1 have compared conclusions with other managers of jumbo programming projects, including F. J. Corbato of M.I.T., John Harr and V. Vyssotsky of Bell Telephone Laboratories, Charles Portman of International Computers Limited, A. P. Ershov of the Computation Laboratory of the Siberian Division, U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, and A. M. Pietrasanta of IBM. My own conclusions are embodied in the essays that follow, which are intended for professional programmers, professional managers, and especially professional managers of programmers. Although written as separable essays, there is a central argument contained especially in Chapters 2-7. Briefly, I believe that large programming projects suffer management problems different in kind from small ones, due to division of labor. I believe the critical need to be the preservation of the conceptual integrity of the product itself. These chapters explore both the difficulties of achieving this unity and methods for doing so. The later chapters explore other aspects of software engineering management.",

Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable: a typical MapReduce computation processes many terabytes of data on thousands of machines. Programmers find the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce programs have been implemented and upwards of one thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google{\rq}s clusters every day.",

@techreport{Leroux_2009,
	abstract = "Do most embedded projects still need an RTOS? It{\rq}s a good question, given the speed of today{\rq}s high-performance processors and the availability of realtime patches for Linux, Windows, and other general-purpose operating systems (GPOSs). The answer lies in the very nature of embedded devices. Devices that are often manufactured in the thousands, or even millions, of units. Devices produced on a scale where even a $1 reduction in per-unit hardware costs can save the manufacturer a small fortune. Devices, in other words, that can{\rq}t afford the cost (not to mention the heat dissipation) of multi-gigahertz processors. In the automotive telematics market, for instance, the typical 32-bit processor runs at about 600 MHz --- far slower than the processors common in desktops and servers. In an environment such as this, an RTOS designed to extract extremely fast, predictable response times from lower-end hardware offers a serious economic advantage. Cost savings aside, the services provided by an RTOS make many computing problems easier to solve, particularly when multiple activities compete for a system{\rq}s resources. Consider, for instance, a system where users expect (or need) immediate response to input. With an RTOS, a developer can guarantee that operations initiated by the user will execute in preference to other system activities, unless a more important activity (for instance, an operation that helps protect the user{\rq}s safety) must execute first. Consider also a system that must satisfy quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as a device that presents live video. If the device depends on software for any part of its content delivery, it can experience dropped frames at a rate that users perceive as unacceptable --- from the users{\rq} perspective, the device is unreliable. With an RTOS, however, the developer can precisely control the order in which software processes execute and ensure that playback occurs at an appropriate and consistent media rate. In most GPOSs, the OS kernel isn{\rq}t preemptible. Consequently, a high-priority user thread can never preempt a kernel call, but must instead wait for the entire call to complete --- even if the call was invoked by the lowest-priority process in the system. Moreover, all priority information is usually lost when a driver or other system service, usually performed in a kernel call, executes on behalf of a client thread. Such behavior causes unpredictable delays and prevents critical activities from completing on time. In an RTOS, on the other hand, kernel operations are preemptible. As in a GPOS, there are time windows during which preemption may not occur; though in a well-designed RTOS, these windows are extremely brief, often in the order of hundreds of nanoseconds. Moreover, the RTOS imposes an upper bound on how long preemption is held off and interrupts disabled; this upper bound allows developers to ascertain worst-case latencies. To realize this goal of consistent predictablility and timely completion of critical activities, the RTOS kernel must be simple and elegant as possible. The best way to achieve this simplicity is to design a kernel that includes only services with a short execution path. By excluding workintensive operations (such as process loading) from the kernel and assigning them to external processes or threads, the RTOS designer can help ensure that there is an upper bound on the longest non-preemptible code path through the kernel.$",

@article{Gibson_1984,
	abstract = "The way in which new species arise has long been a subject of speculation and debate. From Darwin (1869) up to recent times (e.g., Mayr 1970, Fitch 1982) it has been believed that species change gradually over long periods of time. In recent years this concept has been challenged by both paleontologists (e.g., Eldredge and Gould 1972, Gould and Eldredge 1977, Stanley 1975) and geneticists (e.g., Carson 1975, Dover 1982, White 1978a, Wilson, Maxson and Sarich 1974, Wright 1982). One mechanism which has been proposed as important in rapid speciation is changes in chromosomal structure (e.g., White 1978a). This idea has stimulated a great deal of research and discussion. Comparisons based on the number of chromosomes, or the number of chromosome arms, have not generally been helpful in determining relationships between species (e.g., see Greenbaum and Baker 1978). The development of modern techniques of studying chromosomes (see Hsu 1979) has made it possible for scientists to make much more accurate and detailed comparisons of chromosomes in various species of animals. The development of banding techniques, beginning about 1970 (Caspersson, Zech and Johansson 1970, Pardue and Gall 1970, Seabright 1971) made it possible to identify each pair of chromosomes with certainty, at least for most species of mammals, and to compare chromosome structure in different species to an extent not possible previously. This method has received a great amount of attention in recent years (e.g., Fredga 1977, Patton and Sherwood 1983, White 1978a). Results from these kinds of studies have led to the discovery that some species of mammals were actually composed of two or more chromosomal races which could not interbreed. Since interbreeding is the basic criterion for defining a species, each of these chromosomal races can now be considered a separate species (e.g., see Wahrman, Goitein and Nevo 1969). In addition, the results have been important in proposing relationships between species (e.g., Baker, Koop and Haiduk 1983, Rumpler et al. 1983), and even to infer modes of evolutionary change (Bickham and Baker 1979, Key 1968, White 1978b). This paper will review several kinds of chromosome variability and their effects on reproductive success. A future paper will discuss examples of comparative studies of G-banding patterns in chromosomes of mammals, especially those which have been used to propose or to clarify relationships. In summary, there is little doubt that species differences are often associated with chromosomal rearrangements, but this does not show a cause and effect relationship (Patton and Sherwood 1983). Reproductive isolation may be achieved by several genetic mechanisms, among which is chromosomal rearrangement. Many karyotypic differences between species may be the result of different events occurring in populations already reproductively or geographically isolated. Reproductive isolation and chromosomal rearrangements may both be the result of mutations in genes controlling chromosome structure and behavior. Transposable elements may play a part in such mutations, or in other genetic incompatibilities between species. In any case, we do not yet understand the events which connect speciation with chromosomal changes (Fredga 1977).",

	abstract = {Caughley proposed the idea that there are two paradigms within conservation biology: the declining population paradigm and the small population paradigm (Caughley 1994; Caughley \& Gunn 1996). Hedrick et al. claim that such a distinction is "overly simplistic" and "should not be perpetuated," given that "hostile political forces are attempting to discredit many conservation efforts." We suggest that Caughiey's categories are not simple enough. The basic distinction in conservation biology is between field biologists and lab scientists. Caughley is clearly one of the former, whereas Hedrick et al. represent the latter. In our view computer modelers are as much lab scientists as geneticists. Why do the lab scientists have almost all the money? Because advanced capitalist economies are driven by the production and consumption of high-tech gadgetry (Galbraith 1972). Field biologists generally employ pre-industrial technologies like cage traps and bits of string to mark quadrats. By clearly documenting the existence of a dichotomy in conservation biology between the paradigms of "field biologist" and "labscientist," Caughley has given conservationists the ability to perceive the degree to which the lab scientist is pursuing the goal of advancing technology rather than the goal of conservation. Caughley has opened our eyes, and Hedrick et al. worry that we might see that the emperor has no clothes.},

@incollection{Allen_n_Fildes_2009,
	abstract = "Several principles are useful for econometric forecasters: keep the model simple, use all the data you can get, and use theory (not the data) as a guide to selecting causal variables. But theory gives little guidance on dynamics, that is, on which lagged values of the selected variables to use. Early econometric models failed in comparison with extrapolative methods because they paid too little attention to dynamic structure. In a fairly simple way, the vector autoregression (VAR) approach that first appeared in the 1980s resolved the problem by shifting emphasis towards dynamics and away from collecting many causal variables. The VAR approach also resolves the question of how to make long-term forecasts where the causal variables themselves ust be forecast. When the analyst does not need to forecast causal variables or can use other sources, he or she can use a single equation with the same dynamic structure. Ordinary least squares is a perfectly adequate estimation method. Evidence supports estimating the initial equation in levels, whether the variables are stationary or not. We recommend a general-to-specific model-building strategy: start with a large number of lags in the initial estimation, although simplifying by reducing the number of lags pays off. Evidence on the value of further simplification is mixed. If cointegration among variables, then error-correction models (ECMs) will do worse than equations in levels. But ECMs are only sometimes an improvement even when variables are cointegrated. Evidence is even less clear on whether or not to difference variables that are nonstationary on the basis of unit root tests. While some authors recommend applying a battery of misspecification tests, few econometricians use (or at least report using) more than the familiar Durbin-Watson test. Consequently, there is practically no evidence on whether model selection based on these tests will improve forecast performance. Limited evidence on the superiority of varying parameter models hints that tests for parameter constancy are likely to be the most important. Finally, econometric models do appear to be gaining over extrapolative or judgmental methods, even for short- term forecasts, though much more slowly than their proponents had hoped.",

Along with Ruth Pagell, a librarian for the Goizetta Business School at Emory University, I conducted an analysis to estimate the percentage of published papers in forecasting that contain useful knowledge (Armstrong and Pagell 2003). We defined useful knowledge as evidence that could contribute to better decisions than would have otherwise been made in given situations. We concluded that only 3\% met this definition. My opinion, supported by an analysis of literature in marketing (Armstrong 2003), is that the percentage of useful papers in marketing is even lower. I expect readers will come away with the conclusions that researchers should send their papers to the most prestigious journals, and that schools should judge the quality of a paper by the reputation of the journal in which it appears.

	abstract = "This paper examines a strategy for structuring one type of domain knowledge for use in extrapolation. It does so by representing information about causality and using this domain knowledge to select and combine forecasts. We use five categories to express causal impacts upon trends: growth, decay, supporting, opposing, and regressing. An identification of causal forces aided in the determination of weights for combining extrapolation forecasts. These weights improved average ex ante forecast accuracy when tested on 104 annual economic and demographic time series. Gains in accuracy were greatest when (1) the causal forces were clearly specified and (2) stronger causal effects were expected, as in longer- range forecasts. One rule suggested by this analysis was: ``Do not extrapolate trends if they are contrary to causal forces.'' We tested this rule by comparing forecasts from a method that implicitly assumes supporting trends (Holt{\rq}s exponential smoothing) with forecasts from the random walk. Use of the rule improved accuracy for 20 series where the trends were contrary; the MdAPE (Median Absolute Percentage Error) was 18\% less for the random walk on 20 one-year ahead forecasts and 40\% less for 20 six-year-ahead forecasts. We then applied the rule to four other data sets. Here, the MdAPE for the random walk forecasts was 17\% less than Holt{\rq}s error for 943 short-range forecasts and 43\% less for 723 long-range forecasts. Our study suggests that the causal assumptions implicit in traditional extrapolation methods are inappropriate for many applications.",

@misc{Hamming_1986,
	abstract = "The title of my talk is, ``You and Your Research.'' It is not about managing research, it is about how you individually do your research. I could give a talk on the other subject - but it's not, it's about you. I'm not talking about ordinary run-of-the-mill research; I'm talking about great research. And for the sake of describing great research I'll occasionally say Nobel-Prize type of work. It doesn't have to gain the Nobel Prize, but I mean those kinds of things which we perceive are significant things. Relativity, if you want, Shannon's information theory, any number of outstanding theories - that's the kind of thing I'm talking about. 1. One of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage. Once you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems, then you can. If you think you can't, almost surely you are not going to. 2. Age is another factor which the physicists particularly worry about. They always are saying that you have got to do it when you are young or you will never do it. But let me say why age seems to have the effect it does. In the first place if you do some good work you will find yourself on all kinds of committees and unable to do any more work. When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for an encore? The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn't the way things go. So that is another reason why you find that when you get early recognition it seems to sterilize you. 3. ``Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.'' Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. On this matter of drive Edison says, ``Genius is 99\% perspiration and 1\% inspiration.'' He may have been exaggerating, but the idea is that solid work, steadily applied, gets you surprisingly far. The steady application of effort with a little bit more work, intelligently applied is what does it. That's the trouble; drive, misapplied, doesn't get you anywhere. 4. There's another trait on the side which I want to talk about; that trait is ambiguity. It took me a while to discover its importance. Most people like to believe something is or is not true. Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very well. They believe the theory enough to go ahead; they doubt it enough to notice the errors and faults so they can step forward and create the new replacement theory. If you believe too much you'll never notice the flaws; if you doubt too much you won't get started. It requires a lovely balance. But most great scientists are well aware of why their theories are true and they are also well aware of some slight misfits which don't quite fit and they don't forget it. It comes down to an emotional commitment. Most great scientists are completely committed to their problem. Those who don't become committed seldom produce outstanding, first-class work. 5. And I started asking, ``What are the important problems of your field?'' And after a week or so, ``What important problems are you working on?'' And after some more time I came in one day and said, ``If what you are doing is not important, and if you don't think it is going to lead to something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?'' Let me warn you, `important problem' must be phrased carefully. The three outstanding problems in physics, in a certain sense, were never worked on while I was at Bell Labs. By important I mean guaranteed a Nobel Prize and any sum of money you want to mention. We didn't work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. It's not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack. That is what makes a problem important. Most great scientists know many important problems. They have something between 10 and 20 important problems for which they are looking for an attack. And when they see a new idea come up, one hears them say ``Well that bears on this problem.'' They drop all the other things and get after it. The great scientists, when an opportunity opens up, get after it and they pursue it. They drop all other things. They get rid of other things and they get after an idea because they had already thought the thing through. Their minds are prepared; they see the opportunity and they go after it. 6. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and effect sequence because you might say, ``The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.'' I don't know. But I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss fame. 7. You should do your job in such a fashion that others can build on top of it, so they will indeed say, ``Yes, I've stood on so and so's shoulders and I saw further.'' The essence of science is cumulative. By changing a problem slightly you can often do great work rather than merely good work. Instead of attacking isolated problems, I made the resolution that I would never again solve an isolated problem except as characteristic of a class. 8. I have now come down to a topic which is very distasteful; it is not sufficient to do a job, you have to sell it. `Selling' to a scientist is an awkward thing to do. It's very ugly; you shouldn't have to do it. The world is supposed to be waiting, and when you do something great, they should rush out and welcome it. But the fact is everyone is busy with their own work. You must present it so well that they will set aside what they are doing, look at what you've done, read it, and come back and say, ``Yes, that was good.'' I suggest that when you open a journal, as you turn the pages, you ask why you read some articles and not others. You had better write your report so when it is published in the Physical Review, or wherever else you want it, as the readers are turning the pages they won't just turn your pages but they will stop and read yours. If they don't stop and read it, you won't get credit. (See Sand-Jensen 2007) 9. You find this happening again and again; good scientists will fight the system rather than learn to work with the system and take advantage of all the system has to offer. It has a lot, if you learn how to use it. It takes patience, but you can learn how to use the system pretty well, and you can learn how to get around it. After all, if you want a decision `No', you just go to your boss and get a `No' easy. If you want to do something, don't ask, do it. Present him with an accomplished fact. Don't give him a chance to tell you `No'. But if you want a `No', it's easy to get a `No'. In summary, I claim that some of the reasons why so many people who have greatness within their grasp don't succeed are: they don't work on important problems, they don't become emotionally involved, they don't try and change what is difficult to some other situation which is easily done but is still important, and they keep giving themselves alibis why they don't. They keep saying that it is a matter of luck. I've told you how easy it is; furthermore I've told you how to reform. Therefore, go forth and become great scientists!",

Imperfect Case Data Sensors have only finite resolving power and less than 100\% reliability. Human reports may be ambiguous or inaccurate. Evidence from different sources may be missing or in conflict. Even if exact data were available, it may be too costly in time or resources to get it. Whatever the source of uncertainty, we need our AI systems to be able to deal with it. 1. We began by looking at the sources and types of uncertainty that most AI systems must be able to deal with. 2. We then went through the ideas of standard probability theory, including Bayes{\rq} Rule, and how this leads to Bayesian Belief Networks. 3. We then considered Dempster-Shafer Theory and Fuzzy Logic, which are often more tractable approaches. 4. We ended with a brief comparison of the various uncertainty treatments.",

@book{Koller_n_Friedman_2005,
	abstract = "The framework of probabilistic graphical models is quite broad, and it encompasses both a variety of different types of models and a range of methods relating to them. This book describes several types of models. For each one, we describe the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning. We begin in part I, by describing the most basic type of graphical models, which are the focus of most of the book. These models encode distributions over a fixed set X of random variables. We describe how graphs can be used to encode distributions over such spaces, and what the properties of such distributions are. Specifically, in chapter 3, we describe the Bayesian network representation, based on directed graphs. We describe how a Bayesian network can encode a probability distribution. We also analyze the independence properties induced by the graph structure. In chapter 4, we move to Markov networks, the other main category of probabilistic graphical models. Here also we describe the independencies defined by the graph and the induced factorization of the distribution. We also discuss the relationship between Markov networks and Bayesian networks, and briefly describe a framework that unifies both. In chapter 5, we delve a little deeper into the representation of the parameters in probabilistic models, focusing mostly on Bayesian networks, whose parameterization is more constrained. We describe representations that capture some of the finer-grained structure of the distribution, and show that, here also, capturing structure can provide significant gains. In chapter 6, we turn to formalisms that extend the basic framework of probabilistic graphical models to settings where the set of variables is no longer rigidly circumscribed in advance. One such setting is a temporal one, where we wish to model a system whose state evolves over time, requiring us to consider distributions over entire trajectories, We describe a compact representation --- a dynamic Bayesian network --- that allows us to represent structured systems that evolve over time. We then describe a family of extensions that introduce various forms of higher level structure into the framework of probabilistic graphical models. Specifically, we focus on domains containing objects (whether concrete or abstract), characterized by attributes, and related to each other in various ways. Such domains can include repeated structure, since different objects of the same type share the same probabilistic model. These languages provide a significant extension to the expressive power of the standard graphical models. In chapter 7, we take a deeper look at models that include continuous variables. Specifically, we explore the properties of the multivariate Gaussian distribution and the representation of such distributions as both directed and undirected graphical models. Although the class of Gaussian distributions is a limited one and not suitable for all applications, it turns out to play a critical role even when dealing with distributions that are not Gaussian. In chapter 8, we take a deeper, more technical look at probabilistic models, defining a general framework called the exponential family, that encompasses a broad range of distributions. This chapter provides some basic concepts and tools that will turn out to play an important role in later development. We then turn, in part II, to a discussion of the inference task. In chapter 9, we describe the basic ideas underlying exact inference in probabilistic graphical models. We first analyze the fundamental difficulty of the exact inference task, separately from any particular inference algorithm we might develop. We then present two basic algorithms for exact inference --- variable elimination and conditioning --- both of which are equally applicable to both directed and undirected models. Both of these algorithms can be viewed as operating over the graph structure defined by the probabilistic model. They build on basic concepts, such as graph properties and dynamic programming algorithms, to provide efficient solutions to the inference task. We also provide an analysis of their computational cost in terms of the graph structure, and we discuss where exact inference is feasible. In chapter 10, we describe an alternative view of exact inference, leading to a somewhat different algorithm. The benefit of this alternative algorithm is twofold. First, it uses dynamic programming to avoid repeated computations in settings where we wish to answer more than a single query using the same network. Second, it defines a natural algorithm that uses message passing on a graph structure; this algorithm forms the basis for approximate inference algorithms developed in later chapters. Because exact inference is computationally intractable for many models of interest, we then proceed to describe approximate inference algorithms, which trade off accuracy with computational cost. We present two main classes of such algorithms. In chapter 11, we describe a class of methods that can be viewed from two very different perspectives: On one hand, they are direct generalizations of the graph-based message-passing approach developed for the case of exact inference in chapter 10. On the other hand, they can be viewed as solving an optimization problem: one where we approximate the distribution of interest using a simpler representation that allows for feasible inference. The equivalence of these views provides important insights and suggests a broad family of algorithms that one can apply to approximate inference. In chapter 12, we describe a very different class of methods: particle-based methods, which approximate a complex joint distribution by considering samples from it (also known as particles). We describe several methods from this general family. These methods are generally based on core techniques from statistics, such as importance sampling and Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods. Once again, the connection to this general class of methods suggests multiple opportunities for new algorithms. While the representation of probabilistic graphical models applies, to a great extent, to models including both discrete and continuous-valued random variables, inference in models involving continuous variables is significantly more challenging than the purely discrete case. In chapter 14, we consider the task of inference in continuous and hybrid (continuous/discrete) networks, and we discuss whether and how the exact and approximate inference methods developed in earlier chapters can be applied in this setting. The representation that we discussed in chapter 6 allows a compact encoding of networks whose size can be unboundedly large. Such networks pose particular challenges to inference algorithms. In this chapter, we discuss some special-purpose methods that have been developed for the particular settings of networks that model dynamical systems. We then turn, in part III, to the third of our main topics --- learning probabilistic models from data. We begin in chapter 16 by reviewing some of the fundamental concepts underlying the general task of learning models from data. We then present the spectrum of learning problems that we address in this part of the book. These problems vary along two main axes: the extent to which we are given prior knowledge specifying the model, and whether the data from which we learn contain complete observations of all of the relevant variables. In contrast to the inference task, where the same algorithms apply equally to Bayesian networks and Markov networks, the learning task is quite different for these two classes of models. We begin with studying the learning task for Bayesian networks. In chapter 17, we focus on the most basic learning task: learning parameters for a Bayesian network with a given structure, from fully observable data. Although this setting may appear somewhat restrictive, it turns out to form the basis for our entire development of Bayesian network learning. As we show, the factorization of the distribution, which was central both to representation and to inference, also plays a key role in making inference feasible. We then move, in chapter 18, to the harder problem of learning both Bayesian network structure and the parameters, still from fully observed data. The learning algorithms we present trade off the accuracy with which the learned network represents the empirical distribution for the complexity of the resulting structure. As we show, the type of independence assumptions underlying the Bayesian network representation often hold, at least approximately, in real-world distributions. Thus, these learning algorithms often result in reasonably compact structures that capture much of the signal in the distribution. In chapter 19, we address the Bayesian network learning task in a setting where we have access only to partial observations of the relevant variables (for example, when the available patient records have missing entries). This type of situation occurs often in real-world settings. Unfortunately, the resulting learning task is considerably harder, and the resulting algorithms are both more complex and less satisfactory in terms of their performance. We conclude the discussion of learning in chapter 20 by considering the problem of learning Markov networks from data. It turns out that the learning tasks for Markov networks are significantly harder than the corresponding problem for Bayesian networks. We explain the difficulties and discuss the existing solutions. Finally, in part IV, we turn to a different type of extension, where we consider the use of this framework for other forms of reasoning. Specifically, we consider cases where we can act, or intervene, in the world. In chapter 21, we focus on the semantics of intervention and its relation to causality. We present the notion of a causal model, which allows us to answer not only queries of the form ``if I observe X, what do I learn about Y,'' but also intervention queries, of the form ``if I manipulate X, what effect does it have on Y.'' We then turn to the task of decision making under uncertainty. Here, we must consider not only the distribution over different states of the world, but also the preferences of the agent regarding these outcomes. In chapter 22, we discuss the notion of utility functions and how they can encode an agent{\rq}s preferences about complex situations involving multiple variables. As we show, the same ideas that we used to provide compact representations of probability distribution can also be used for utility functions. In chapter 23, we describe a unified representation for decision making, called influence diagrams. Influence diagrams extend Bayesian networks by introducing actions and utilities. We present algorithms that use influence diagrams for making decisions that optimize the agent{\rq}s expected utility. These algorithms utilize many of the same ideas that formed the basis for exact inference in Bayesian networks. We conclude with a high-level synthesis of the techniques covered in this book, and with some guidance on how to use them in tackling a new problem.",

	abstract = "The problem of fusing beliefs in the Dempster--Shafer belief theory has attracted considerable attention over the last two decades. The classical Dempster{\rq}s rule has often been criticised, and many alternative rules for belief fusion have been proposed in the literature. We show that it is crucial to consider the nature of the situation to be modelled and to select the appropriate fusion operator as a function thereof. In this paper, we present the cumulative rule and the averaging rule of belief fusion, which represent generalisations of the subjective logic consensus operator for independent and dependent opinions respectively. The generalised operators are applicable to the combination of general basic belief assignments (bbas). These rules, which can be directly derived from classical statistical theory, produce results that correspond well with human intuition. Different situations require different types of belief fusion. We have described the cumulative and the averaging belief fusion rules which can be used for belief fusion in situations where Dempster{\rq}s rule is inadequate. The two new rules represent generalisations of the corresponding fusion operators for opinions used in subjective logic, and have been derived from classical Bayesian analysis through a bijective mapping between Dirichlet distributions and belief functions. This simple mapping positions belief theory and statistical theory closely and firmly together. This is important in order to make belief theory more practical and easier to interpret, and to make belief theory more acceptable in the main stream statistics and probability communities.",

Deficiency of wild prey biomass is often described as a driver of such conflicts, but the question ``at which level of prey density and biomass do big cats begin to kill livestock?'' still remains unanswered. We applied logistic regression to meta-data compiled from recent peer-reviewed scientific publications and show that cattle predation is high when prey biomass is b812.41 ± 1.26 kg/km2, whereas sheep and goat predation is high at b 544.57 ± 1.19 kg/km2, regardless of sizes of study areas and species, body masses, and population densities of big cats. Through mapping cases with known prey biomass and case-specific comparison of actual vs. threshold-predicted livestock predation we confirm the reliability of these thresholds in predicting livestock predation by big cats. The map also demonstrates that some protected areas of India, Nepal lowlands, and South Africa contain sufficient prey that makes big cats less likely to kill livestock, but in other sampled areas prey biomass is not high enough and the probabilities of livestock predation are moderate to high. We suggest that these thresholds represent important landmarks for predicting human--felid conflicts, identifying conflict hotspots, and setting priorities for targeted conservation actions. It is essential to maintain and restore wild prey to forestall local extinctions of big cats.",

P-values can indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model. 2.

Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold. 4. Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency. 5. A p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result. 6. By itself, a p-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis. Statisticians often supplement or even replace p-values with other approaches.

	abstract = {1. Are the caracal(s) still effective in keeping away the jackals from livestock? We only introduced caracals once at the beginning. We had too many jackals and put the caracals back to correct the balance. Over the years the caracals have been killed by the neighbourswhen they step over the boundary fence. We do, however, have established jackal and caracal that keep any intruders away. The caracals and jackals that live here now do not bother the livestock. What we do now is use the faeces from the captive cats we have in our programme (www.karoocats.org) . We place this in the area in which the sheep are living twice a week. We have now established a fictitious territory around the sheep and do not have any predator problems. 2. Any difference in effectiveness between mountainous "bergveld" and the flats? (Or other areas). I would not think so. If you use the faeces method, it should work in any terrain. We have a farmer nearby who has started using this method to protect his copper springbok from predators. 3. Have any of the caracals started killing livestock? If yes, still smaller numbers than the jackals? Any difference between males and females? No, we have not had caracals or jackals killing the livestock. We know that there are 2 pair of jackals on the property and we sometimes see their pups. The adults are old as they are greying. We do not notice any difference between the males and females. I have read that it would be the females caracals in the flats and the males in the mountainous area. I cannot remember what paper I read that in as it was some time ago. 4. Do you think it is a realistic method to recommend to Namibian livestock farmers? I feel that any non lethal method is worth a try. We have found that the faeces method works well for us. There must not be any dog packs running through the area nor any night shooting etc. They must be left alone with this method. As each microenvironment is different, you may find different success. It also depends on the food availability for the predators. If the property is over utilised and there is nothing for the predator to eat, then they have no choice but to eat the livestock. 5. How cost-effective is it? What are the costs to releasing a caracals on your farm and what difference did it make to your percentage of lambs weaned per year? We only did the release at the beginning to get the jackals under control. No more releases since then. About 6 years ago we started to drastically reduce the number of sheep and now only have just over a 100 as we converted to game. With the sheep that we do have now, we have no losses to predation. Our main form of income is hunting. We do not hunt caracals or jackals. 6. Any gotchas or things to keep in mind that might influence the effectiveness? Once this project was started, the important thing is to stay away. Farmers in this area cannot even try this as it is ingrained for them to send dog packs through the veld and go at night calling to try and shoot them. The faeces will not work if you keep harassing the predators. Once you have {\lq}established{\rq} the new predator territory using this method, it must be continued. If you have predators that do not eat the livestock, they must be left alone as they will keep any {\lq}delinquents{\rq} out. We have numerous farmers that have complained that when they relented and allowed someone to shoot a caracal or jackal on their farm, they have had nothing but trouble since.},

	abstract = "Unfortunately, although regulatory protections were increased for some important species, for many others the issue remains unresolved. In fact, despite consumer boycotts and international agreements such as CITES, most efforts to promote more sustainable use of natural resources have failed, often for the same reason --- they have not provided direct incentives for conservation. However, recent examples of conservation agreements and land purchases are concrete evidence that direct financing can be a viable and cost-effect approach to conservation. Sustainable-management policies with their harvest restrictions are more costly and hence less profitable to local industry than is conventional logging. (Mahogany - Swietenia spp.) Despite a rapidly shrinking commercial range, poor regeneration following harvest, and an almost complete absence of control of logging, efforts to list mahogany as a protected species on CITES (Appendix II) have failed --- not once but three times. The ineffectiveness of international agreements has led some environmentalists to encourage boycotts. For boycotts to work, they must affect the majority of importing countries, with few or no alternative markets available. In the case of mahogany, even a global boycott would not solve the problem because it would provide no direct incentive for mahogany conservation. The lesson from the shortfalls of CITES, boycotts and sustainable management in protecting mahogany is that conservation must be the direct objective of policy, rather than a desired by-product, to ensure that trade does not threaten valuable species. Existing initiatives now require that resource owners conserve for no reward, or even at a net cost. However, in our view, paying for direct protection is simply a practical means of compensating those who conserve resources of global importance. Directly financing protection, moreover, can reinforce alternative approaches to conservation such as sustainable management, by providing a powerful hedge against their failure. If boycotts, sustainable use and CITES continue to be ineffective for mahogany, the future of the species can still be secured by protecting viable populations in nature reserves. To take mahogany as an example, although the signatories to CITES have again failed to list the species on Appendix II, a group of technical experts is to study its situation more closely. We suggest that this working group focuses on identifying remaining intact populations and determining the minimum critical size of viable populations that should be protected.",

	abstract = "A major challenge in conservation is influencing people{\rq}s behaviour. Whether encouraging the public to feed garden birds or lobbying governments to tax carbon emissions, conservationists seek to maintain biodiversity by modifying human actions. This work has parallels in the private sector, where companies increase profits by influencing the purchasing behaviour of their customers (Kotler et al., 1999), and this is why many conservation groups use marketing techniques pioneered in the commercial world. One such development is social marketing, which is defined as {\lq}the systematic application of marketing along with other concepts and techniques to achieve specific behavioural goals for a social good{\rq} (French \& Blair-Stevens, 2006). However, conservation groups also use marketing in a more traditional sense, and this will be the focus of our chapter. Such marketing campaigns may have little effect on individuals{\rq} behaviour, but their impact on fundraising and setting the conservation agenda can be profound (Adams \& Hutton, 2007). Marketing is defined as {\lq}a social and managerial process by which individuals and groups obtain what they want and need through creating, offering and exchanging products of value with others{\rq} (Kotler et al., 1999). This process is an integral part of commerce but its importance grew in the 1960s when demand in developed countries for standardized and undifferentiated products became saturated (Baker, 2008). These techniques vary and so the broad approach is often known as the {\lq}marketing mix{\rq}, which was originally summarized as the {\lq}4 Ps{\rq} of product, price, place and promotion. However, this has subsequently been expanded to the {\lq}7 Ps{\rq} by adding people, process and physical evidence, so that it better covers marketing in service industries.",

To prevent illegal uses of natural resources, such as poaching endangered species, governments have advocated granting policy flexibility to local authorities by liberalizing culling or hunting of large carnivores. We present the first quantitative evaluation of the hypothesis that liberalizing culling will reduce poaching and improve population status of an endangered carnivore. We show that allowing wolf (Canis lupus) culling was substantially more likely to increase poaching than reduce it. Replicated, quasi-experimental changes in wolf policies in Wisconsin and Michigan, USA, revealed that a repeated policy signal to allow state culling triggered repeated slowdowns in wolf population growth, irrespective of the policy implementation measured as the number of wolves killed. The most likely explanation for these slowdowns was poaching and alternative explanations found no support. When the government kills a protected species, the perceived value of each individual of that species may decline; so liberalizing wolf culling may have sent a negative message about the value of wolves or acceptability of poaching. Our results suggest that grant- ing management flexibility for endangered species to address illegal behaviour may instead promote such behaviour.",

Male targeted harvest regimes of males should therefore result in increased sexually segregated habitat use in infanticidal carnivores. We tested the effects of low and high levels of male hunting mortality and associated SSI on sexually segregated habitat use in mountain lions. The ``no effect of hunting'' hypothesis predicts that no sexual segregation would occur or that all female mountain lions would segregate from males because of sexual dimorphism. The ``hunting effect'' hypothesis predicts that females with kittens would segregate from younger immigrant males in the heavily hunted population during summer when kittens are vulnerable to SSI. We rejected the ``no effect'' hypothesis and accepted the ``hunting effect'' hypothesis for mountain lions. Females with kittens avoided immigrant males in the heavily hunted population during summer---others did not. This sexual segregation corresponded with females with kittens selecting for food-poor, high elevations in the heavily hunted population but not in the lightly hunted population. Avoidance of males and selection for high elevations resulted in prey switching by females with kittens from abundant primary prey in lower elevations to rare, sensitive and threatened secondary prey at higher elevations. It appears that remedial sport hunting of mountain lions to reduce predation on declining prey actually caused sexual segregation and increased predation on declining prey. We suggest that excess mortality of male carnivores could result in unanticipated cascade effects including sexual segregation and prey switching to declining prey.",

	abstract = "As Africa{\rq}s human population grows exponentially---from 1.2 billion currently to 2.47 billion in 2050---more land is needed to house people and produce the required food to sustain them. Cultivated land area in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to increase by 21\% and livestock by 73\% within this same period. As human occupation of African savannas expands, interactions between lions and humans become more frequent. Lion prey species compete with livestock grazing in Protected Areas (PAs). Close contact with domestic herds can lead to lions killing livestock, which in turn provokes retaliatory killing of lions by herders and ranchers. This is one of the top three threats in West, Central, East and parts of Southern Africa. Outside official PAs, retaliatory and preemptive killing is considered the primary threat to lions. Human encroachment also leads to illegal bushmeat hunting, a second severe threat to both lions and their prey. Perhaps the single most important step in securing the future of lions in Africa is mobilizing massive support for effective protection and management of its system of PAs. Successful lion conservation requires significantly more resources than are currently allocated to PAs in range states. Outside of these areas, conflict arising from depredation of livestock by lions must be addressed. Reducing the vulnerability of livestock to lion predation and encouraging local people to value lions{\rq} presence are critical steps forward.",

	abstract = "1. Like many wildlife populations across Africa, recent analyses indicate that African lions are declining rapidly outside of small fenced areas. Community conservancies -- privately protected areas that engage community members in conservation -- may potentially maintain wildlife populations in unfenced pastoralist regions, but their effectiveness in conserving large carnivores has been largely unknown until now. 2. We identify drivers of lion survival in community conservancies within the Masai Mara ecosystem, Kenya, applying mark--recapture analyses to continuous sight--resight surveys. We use the number of livestock and human settlements as proxies for potential human--lion conflict whilst controlling for environmental variables and lion socioecology. 3. Average lion densities within the Mara conservancies between 2008 and 2013 (11-87 lions 100 km²) were 2-6 times higher than those previously reported in 2003. Survival rates varied amongst prides and were highest for lions utilizing central regions of conservancies. 4. The number of livestock settlements (bomas [corrals] and manyattas) that were not members of a conservancy, and that fell within a pride home-range, had a large negative effect on female survival and was the most influential external predictor in models. These non-conservancy settlements accounted for 37.2\% of total observed variation in survival, whereas conservancy settlements, which benefit financially from wildlife through their membership, had no effect on lion survival. 5. Internal drivers of survival agreed with known ecology and social behaviour including age plus a negative effect of male takeovers on cub survival <6 months. Vegetation cover, prey availability and the density of grazing livestock within a pride{\rq}s range did not explain patterns in lion survival. 6. Synthesis and applications. We show that lion densities have increased substantially within the Mara conservancies over the last decade and suggest that the creation of community conservancies has benefitted their survival. This suggests that lions can survive outside of fenced areas within pastoral regions if communities gain benefits from wildlife. We highlight the importance of expanding existing conservancies beyond their current geographical and political scope and forming buffer zones if wildlife ranges outside them. We suggest that changing attitudes to predators should be a key goal of community-based conservancies. Further work is recommended to identify what specific aspects of conservancy membership promote lion survival.",

	abstract = "The W-Arly-Pendjari (WAP) ecosystem, shared among Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger, represents the last lion stronghold of West Africa. To assess the impact of trophy hunting on lion populations in hunting areas of the WAP, we analyzed trends in harvest rates from 1999 to 2014. We also investigated whether the hunting areas with higher initial hunting intensity experienced steeper declines in lion harvest between 1999 and 2014, and whether lion densities in hunting areas were lower than in national parks. Lion harvest rate remained overall constant in the WAP. At initial hunting intensities below 1.5 lions/1000km2, most hunting areas experienced an increase in lion harvest rate, although that increase was of lower magnitude for hunting areas with higher initial hunting intensity. The proportion of hunting areas that experienced a decline in lion harvest rate increased at initial hunting intensities above 1.5 lions/1000km2. In 2014, the lion population of the WAP was estimated with a spoor count at 418 (230--648) adults and sub-adult individuals, comparable to the 311 (123--498) individuals estimated in the previous 2012 spoor survey. We found no significant lion spoor density differences between national parks and hunting areas. Hunting areas with higher mean harvest rates did not have lower lion densities. The ratio of large adult males, females and sub-adults was similar between the national parks and the hunting areas. These results suggested that the lion population was not significantly affected by hunting in the WAP. We concluded that a quota of 1 lion/1000km2 would be sustainable for the WAP. Based on our results, an import embargo on lion trophies from the WAP would not be justified. It could ruin the incentive of local actors to conserve lions in hunting areas, and lead to a drastic reduction of lion range in West Africa.",

Livestock guarding dogs are promoted as a non-lethal, environmentally friendly method to mitigate this conflict. As part of a farmer--carnivore conflict mitigation programme, the Cheetah Conservation Fund breeds Anatolian shepherd (also known as Kangal) dogs to protect livestock from predators. During 2009-2010 we interviewed 53 commercial and 20 subsistence Namibian farmers that are using 83 such dogs. Fewer commercial and subsistence farmers reported livestock losses to predators during the most recent year of guarding-dog use compared to the year before dogs were introduced. All subsistence farmers, but not all commercial farmers, ceased killing predators during the most recent year of guarding-dog use. All farmers ceased killing cheetah Acinonyx jubatus and leopard Panthera pardus during this year, and one dog killed a single cheetah. Conversely, dogs and farmers killed more black-backed jackals Canis mesomelas between them in the survey year than the farmers reported killing in the year before acquiring dogs. Two of the dogs reportedly killed non-target carnivore species, and 15 killed prey species. Thus our results challenge the categorization of livestock guarding dogs as a non-lethal conflict mitigation method. We suggest that the conservation status and body size of wild carnivores relative to the size of the guarding dogs be considered before introducing dogs to protect livestock. Additionally, corrective training for dogs that chase or kill non-target species should be implemented, especially where farmers value these species or where non-target species are threatened.",

Public acceptance is higher than historically but there is a need to identify effective, acceptable techniques to facilitate coexistence. We present a case study of predation on livestock in Slovakia. Damage, mitigation measures and public opinion were assessed using compensation records, analysis of farm conditions, questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interviews, diet analysis and on-farm trials of livestock-guarding dogs. Economic damage was inconsequential on a national scale but high locally: c. 80\% of reported losses occurred at 12\% of sheep flocks. Grey wolves Canis lupus were held responsible for four to six times more damage than brown bears Ursus arctos, although livestock occurred in only 2 of 78 wolf faeces during spring--autumn, when sheep and cattle were most vulnerable. Losses to Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx were negligible. Compared to other sectors of society shepherds had the most negative attitudes, particularly towards wolves, despite compensation payments. Appropriate use of livestock-guarding dogs was associated with fewer losses: median loss at trial flocks with predation was 70\% lower than at control flocks. We conclude that identifying vulnerable farms and targeting them for mitigation could reduce damage, although lack of motivation and awareness are obstacles. This study shows that damage levels need not be excessive despite high predator densities in human-dominated landscapes. Conflicts were unevenly distributed, with much of the variation explained by local conditions and husbandry practices, especially preventive measures.

Quantifying the attitudes of land owners towards carnivores and understanding the factors that influence these attitudes are instrumental in conservation planning and reducing persecution-related threats to carnivores. However, information about attitudes to carnivores in Africa, and South Africa in particular, is scarce. To obtain such data we interviewed 170 commercial game and livestock farmers in two ecologically important rural areas of northern South Africa. Responses to statements about carnivore management, stock protection and predation were generally positive. However, 62\% of respondents believed carnivores to be financially damaging and 35\% thought them overly abundant. Many respondents (41\%) were unwilling to tolerate even low levels of predation and considered persecution of carnivores to be the cheapest form of stock protection (31\%). Attitudes were significantly more positive among respondents who did not kill carnivores than among those who did. Generalized linear regression coupled with information theoretic analysis showed that attitudes to carnivores were determined by a combination of cultural and land-use attributes more than by economic factors such as stock holdings or predation losses. The results elucidate potential targets for mitigation activities and facilitate the development of communication, education and extension activities specifically designed to appeal to intended recipients and address prevalent motives for persecuting carnivores.",

	abstract = "Many democratic governments recognize a duty to conserve environmental resources, including wild animals, as a public trust for current and future citizens. These public trust principles have informed two centuries of U.S.A. Supreme Court decisions and environmental laws worldwide. Nevertheless numerous populations of large-bodied, mammalian carnivores (predators) were eradicated in the 20th century. Environmental movements and strict legal protections have fostered predator recoveries across the U.S.A. and Europe since the 1970s. Now subnational jurisdictions are regaining management authority from central governments for their predator subpopulations. Will the history of local eradication repeat or will these jurisdictions adopt public trust thinking and their obligation to broad public interests over narrower ones? We review the role of public trust principles in the restoration and preservation of controversial species. In so doing we argue for the essential roles of scientists from many disciplines concerned with biological diversity and its conservation. We look beyond species endangerment to future generations{\rq} interests in sustainability, particularly non-consumptive uses. Although our conclusions apply to all wild organisms, we focus on predators because of the particular challenges they pose for government trustees, trust managers, and society. Gray wolves Canis lupus L. deserve particular attention, because detailed information and abundant policy debates across regions have exposed four important challenges for preserving predators in the face of interest group hostility. One challenge is uncertainty and varied interpretations about public trustees{\rq} responsibilities for wildlife, which have created a mosaic of policies across jurisdictions. We explore how such mosaics have merits and drawbacks for biodiversity. The other three challenges to conserving wildlife as public trust assets are illuminated by the biology of predators and the interacting behavioural ecologies of humans and predators. The scientific community has not reached consensus on sustainable levels of human-caused mortality for many predator populations. This challenge includes both genuine conceptual uncertainty and exploitation of scientific debate for political gain. Second, human intolerance for predators exposes value conflicts about preferences for some wildlife over others and balancing majority rule with the protection of minorities in a democracy. We examine how differences between traditional assumptions and scientific studies of interactions between people and predators impede evidence-based policy. Even if the prior challenges can be overcome, well-reasoned policy on wild animals faces a greater challenge than other environmental assets because animals and humans change behaviour in response to each other in the short term. These coupled, dynamic responses exacerbate clashes between uses that deplete wildlife and uses that enhance or preserve wildlife. Viewed in this way, environmental assets demand sophisticated, careful accounting by disinterested trustees who can both understand the multidisciplinary scientific measurements of relative costs and benefits among competing uses, and justly balance the needs of all beneficiaries including future generations. Without public trust principles, future trustees will seldom prevail against narrow, powerful, and undemocratic interests. Without conservation informed by public trust thinking predator populations will face repeated cycles of eradication and recovery. Our conclusions have implications for the many subfields of the biological sciences that address environmental trust assets from the atmosphere to aquifers.

	abstract = "Context. Wild predators are a serious threat to livestock in Australia. Livestock guardian dogs (LGDs) may be able to reduce or eliminate predation, but their effectiveness in Australian grazing systems has not been systematically evaluated. In particular, little is known about the effectiveness of LGDs in situations where they range freely over large areas in company with large numbers of livestock. Aims. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of LGDs as currently used in Australia and determine the factors influencing effectiveness, in particular in relation to scale of management. We also documented how LGDs are managed in Australia, evaluated their cost effectiveness, and identified factors that influence the number of dogs required in different property situations. Methods. We conducted a telephone survey of 150 livestock producers with LGDs in Australia, including all livestock types and property situations, in all States. Ten producers were visited, of which one is detailed as a case study. Key results. Effectiveness was apparently high: 65.7\% of respondents reported that predation ceased after obtaining LGDs, and a further 30.2\% reported a decrease of predation. When the number of stock per dog exceeds 100, LGDs might not be able to eliminate all predation. Dogs are often kept free-ranging on large properties where wild dogs are the main predator, but are usually restricted in their movements on smaller properties or with smaller predators. The cost of obtaining a LGD is returned within 1--3 years after the dog starts working. The number of dogs required for a property mainly depends on the number of livestock needing protection, and the main type of predator in the area. Conclusions. Provided a sufficient number of LGDs are used, they can be as effective in protecting livestock from predators in Australia when ranging freely on large properties with large numbers of livestock as they are in small-scale farming systems. Implications. LGDs can provide a cost-effective alternative to conventional predator control methods in Australia{\rq}s extensive grazing enterprises, potentially reducing or eliminating the need for other forms of control. LGDs could play a major role in securing the viability of livestock businesses and reconciling people--predator conflict in Australia.",

The current and previous years{\rq} rainfall decreased the likelihood of future losses, while rainfall from two years prior was positively correlated with future losses.

Results showed that caracal (Caracal caracal) culling increased subsequent livestock losses when compared to farms where fewer caracals were culled. When controlling for lagged rainfall, remoteness and a proxy for other unobserved farm characteristics, a logit model indicated the marginal effect of culling to be a 17.5\% increase in the likelihood of livestock losses during the next year. The corresponding negative binomial model estimated the effect of an additional caracal culled to be a 0.373 unit increase in the number of sheep lost. A lagged rainfall variable was negative and significant in both models. According to the logit results, the marginal millimetre of rain reduced subsequent losses by 1.1\%. For the negative binomial model, the marginal effect of rainfall was reduced losses by 0.047 of a sheep which was about a 5\% increase in losses. The average number of livestock lost was 0.94 sheep per farm per year. Distance travelled, used to proxy remoteness, was positive in the negative binomial model and non-significant in the logit model. Lagged livestock losses were not significant in either model.

Due to increasingly localized control efforts, behavior of individual coyotes in sheep-ranching environments is becoming a more important consideration. We radiotracked 14 coyotes on a year-round sheep-ranching facility in north-coastal California during September 1993-December 1995. Breeding coyote pairs used mutually exclusive territories (maximum overlap between 90\% adaptive kernel home ranges = 4\%). Nonbreeding coyotes were transient or varied in their degree of fidelity to putative natal territories but generallu avoided cores of nonnatal territories. Breeding coyotes whose territories contained sheep were the principal predators of sheep. In the 1994 lambing period (1 Jan-31 May), radiotelemetry indicated that 1 breeding male was responsible for 71\% of 65 kills. In the 1995 lambing period, 4 breeding pairs were strongly implicated in 92\% of 48 kills and were suspected of 85\% of 26 additional kills; nonbreeders were not associated with sheep depredation. Depredation was reduced only when territorial breeders known to kill sheep were removed. These results suggest the need for management to target breeding adults in the immediate vicinity of depredatioin.

Yet accurate predictions of community susceptibility to invasion remain elusive. The diversity resistance hypothesis, which argues that diverse communities are highly competitive and readily resist invasion, is supported by both theory and experimental studies conducted at small spatial scales. However, there is also convincing evidence that the relationship between the diversity of native and invading species is positive when measured at regional scales. Although this latter relationship may arise from extrinsic factors, such as resource heterogeneity, that covary with diversity of native and invading species at large scales, the mechanisms conferring greater invasion resistance to diverse communities at local scales remain unknown. Using neighbourhood analyses, a technique from plant competition studies, we show here that species diversity in small experimental grassland plots enhances invasion resistance by increasing crowding and species richness in localized plant neighbourhoods. Both the establishment (number of invaders) and success (proportion of invaders that are large) of invading plants are reduced. These results suggest that local biodiversity represents an important line of defence against the spread of invaders.",

A semi-structured questionnaire was used to acquire the required information from the respondents. We found that the majority of the Maasai pastoralists, particularly females, expressed negative attitudes towards the conservation of large carnivores. The reasons given for disliking carnivores differed between the sexes, but the most common reasons were that the carnivores attacked the respondents{\rq} livestock at night and also purposefully and frequently attacked people. The Maasai pastoralists who had been to school, mostly males, expressed more positive attitudes than those who had not been to school.

Bear (Ursus americanus) hunters were concerned about losing valuable hounds to wolves and were more likely to approve of lethal control and reducing the wolf population than were livestock producers, who were more concerned than general residents. To a lesser degree, education level, experience of loss, and gender were also significant. Livestock producers and bear hunters who had been compensated for their losses to wolves were not more tolerant than their counterparts who alleged a loss but received no compensation. Yet all respondents approved of compensation payments as a management strategy. Our results indicate that deep-rooted social identity and occupation are more powerful predictors of tolerance of wolves than individual encounters with these large carnivores.",

	abstract = "Most large carnivore species are in global decline. Conflict with local people, particularly over depredation on livestock, is a major cause of this decline, affecting both nominally protected populations and those outside protected areas. For this reason, techniques that can resolve conflicts between large carnivores and livestock farmers may make important contributions to conservation. We monitored rates of livestock depredation by lions (Panthera leo), leopards (Panthera pardus), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), and retributive killing of these species by farmers in livestock-producing areas of Laikipia District, Kenya. Farmers killed more lions, leopards, and spotted hyenas where these predators killed more livestock. Livestock husbandry had a clear effect on rates of depredation and hence on the numbers of predators killed. Cattle, sheep, and goats experienced the lowest predation rates when attentively herded by day and enclosed in traditional corrals (bomas) by night. Construction of the boma, the presence of watchdogs, and high levels of human activity around the boma were all associated with lower losses to predators. Although most of this work was carried out on commercial ranches, local Maasai and Samburu pastoralists have practiced nearly identical forms of husbandry for generations. Our study shows that traditional, low-tech husbandry approaches can make an important contribution to the conservation of large carnivores.",

	abstract = "Efforts to understand the ecological regulation of species diversity via bottom-up approaches have failed to yield a consensus theory. Theories based on the alternative of top-down regulation have fared better. Paine{\rq}s discovery of keystone predation demonstrated that the regulation of diversity via top-down forcing could be simple, strong, and direct, yet ecologists have persistently failed to perceive generality in Paine{\rq}s result. Removing top predators destabilizes many systems and drives transitions to radically distinct alternative states. These transitions typically involve community reorganization and loss of diversity, implying that top-down forcing is crucial to diversity maintenance. Contrary to the expectations of bottom-up theories, many terrestrial herbivores and mesopredators are capable of sustained order-of-magnitude population increases following release from predation, negating the assumption that populations of primary consumers are resource limited and at or near carrying capacity. Predation sensu lato (to include Janzen--Connell mortality agents) has been shown to promote diversity in a wide range of ecosystems, including rocky intertidal shelves, coral reefs, the nearshore ocean, streams, lakes, temperate and tropical forests, and arctic tundra. The compelling variety of these ecosystems suggests that top-down forcing plays a universal role in regulating diversity. This conclusion is further supported by studies showing that the reduction or absence of predation leads to diversity loss and, in the more dramatic cases, to catastrophic regime change. Here, I expand on the thesis that diversity is maintained by the interaction between predation and competition, such that strong top-down forcing reduces competition, allowing coexistence. carrying capacity",

@article{Ripple_et_al_2014,
	abstract = "Background: The largest terrestrial species in the order Carnivora are wide-ranging and rare because of their positions at the top of food webs. They are some of the world{\rq}s most admired mammals and, ironically, some of the most imperiled. Most have experienced substantial population declines and range contractions throughout the world during the past two centuries. Because of the high metabolic demands that come with endothermy and large body size, these carnivores often require large prey and expansive habitats. These food requirements and wide-ranging behavior often bring them into conflict with humans and livestock. This, in addition to human intolerance, renders them vulnerable to extinction. Large carnivores face enormous threats that have caused massive declines in their populations and geographic ranges, including habitat loss and degradation, persecution, utilization, and depletion of prey. We highlight how these threats can affect the conservation status and ecological roles of this planet{\rq}s 31 largest carnivores. Advances: Based on empirical studies, trophic cascades have been documented for 7 of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores (not including pinnipeds). For each of these species (see figure), human actions have both caused declines and contributed to recovery, providing ``natural experiments'' for quantifying their effects on food-web and community structure. Large carnivores deliver economic and ecosystem services via direct and indirect pathways that help maintain mammal, avian, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness. Further, they affect other ecosystem processes and conditions, such as scavenger subsidies, disease dynamics, carbon storage, stream morphology, and crop production. The maintenance or recovery of ecologically effective densities of large carnivores is an important tool for maintaining the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Outlook: Current ecological knowledge indicates that large carnivores are necessary for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem function. Human actions cannot fully replace the role of large carnivores. Additionally, the future of increasing human resource demands and changing climate will affect biodiversity and ecosystem resiliency. These facts, combined with the importance of resilient ecosystems, indicate that large carnivores and their habitats should be maintained and restored wherever possible. Preventing the extinction of these species and the loss of their irreplaceable ecological function and importance will require novel, bold, and deliberate actions. We propose a Global Large Carnivore Initiative to coordinate local, national, and international research, conservation, and policy. Large carnivores face serious threats and are experiencing massive declines in their populations and geographic ranges around the world. We highlight how these threats have affected the conservation status and ecological functioning of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores on Earth. Consistent with theory, empirical studies increasingly show that large carnivores have substantial effects on the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Significant cascading trophic interactions, mediated by their prey or sympatric mesopredators, arise when some of these carnivores are extirpated from or repatriated to ecosystems. Unexpected effects of trophic cascades on various taxa and processes include changes to bird, mammal, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness; subsidies to scavengers; altered disease dynamics; carbon sequestration; modified stream morphology; and crop damage. Promoting tolerance and coexistence with large carnivores is a crucial societal challenge that will ultimately determine the fate of Earth{\rq}s largest carnivores and all that depends upon them, including humans.",

During the 1990s the official programmes were phased out due to a multitude of factors including lower predation rates. Today, thousands of livestock (primarily sheep and goats, but also cattle and wildlife) are lost each day in South Africa due to black-backed jackal and caracal predation. The actual numbers are not known because not all losses are accounted or reported. It also does not account for the scores of cattle and wildlife lost to black-backed jackals and caracals, nor does it include livestock predation from other predators. To address the losses, the major producer organizations including the National Wool Growers{\rq} Association of South Africa, the South African Mohair Growers{\rq} Association, the Red Meat Producers Organization, and Wildlife Ranching SA formed the Predation Management Forum in 2009. The overall goal of the Predation Management Forum is to address predation by black-backed jackals and caracals by reestablishing a national program to include the national government of South Africa, provincial governments, and producers. Currently, the Predation Management Forum is actively engaging in initiatives to address predation in South Africa to ensure food security, biodiversity, and jobs.

We sought to evaluate whether translocating stock-raiding leopards (Panthera pardus) into a protected area with resident conspecifics in Botswana is effective in dealing with {\lq}problem{\rq} carnivores. Methods. We assessed release-site fidelity, ranging behaviour, individual survival and reduction of conflict after translocation of four translocated leopards in relation to four resident conspecifics, which were tracked from 24 days up to 4 years. Key results. None of the translocated leopards showed release-site fidelity; they either returned to the trap site or showed extensive roaming behaviour after release. Three of the four translocated leopards reportedly resumed stock-raiding and were shot when ranging outside of protected areas, which apparently was a consequence of being released into an area already occupied by territorial conspecifics. On the basis of satellite telemetry, the linear movement distance of one translocated leopard (1249 km) and the range size of three resident female leopards (513 - 124 km2) are the largest on record. Conclusions. From comparing the survival and ranging behaviour of translocated leopards with that of resident conspecifics, we conclude that translocation was not an effective management tool for dealing with stock-raiding leopards in our study.

Rather than translocating {\lq}problem{\rq} carnivores, efforts should focus on reducing the potential for problems to develop, most importantly on improving livestock-husbandry practices.",

No significant genetic discontinuities were definable within the southern African leopard population. Analysis of fine-scale genetic data derived from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA revealed that the primary natural process shaping the spatial genetic structure of the species is isolation-by-distance (IBD). The effective gene dispersal (s) index can inform leopard translocations and is estimated to be 82 km for some South African leopards.

	abstract = "We examined the efficacy of a translocation program in which large numbers of leopards (Panthera pardus fusca) were trapped in human-dominated landscapes where livestock attacks were common and human attacks rare and released into adjoining forested areas in an attempt to reduce leopard presence and mitigate conflicts at the capture site. In the year starting in February of 2001, 29 leopards were captured in the human-dominated rural landscape of the Junnar region (4275 km2, 185 people/km2), Maharashtra, India, and released an average of 39.5 km away in adjoining forests. Eleven leopards were also relocated to the same forests from other districts. Prior to the large-scale translocation program, an average of four leopard attacks on humans occurred each year between 1993 and 2001. After the translocation program was initiated, the average increased substantially to 17 attacks. Linear and logistic models showed that attack frequency increased in Junnar following nearby releases of leopards and decreased when leopards were removed for releases far away; that attacks became more lethal when the number of leopards introduced from other districts increased; and that attacks were most likely to occur in the regions where the largest number of leopards had been introduced from other areas. These results suggest that leopards did not stay at the release sites and that translocation induced attacks on people. Potential explanations for these results include increased aggression induced by stress of the translocation process, movement through unfamiliar human-dominated landscapes following release, and loss of fear of humans due to familiarity with humans acquired during captivity. Our results show that reactive solutions to attacks on humans by leopards, such as translocation, could in fact increase human--leopard conflict. Measures to reduce human--carnivore conflicts may include more effective compensation procedures to pay livestock owners for the loss of animals to predation by carnivores, providing better methods of protection for livestock, and encouraging greater social acceptance of the presence of carnivores in human-dominated landscapes.",

Even those individuals that do not succeed in returning home roam over very large distances, best measured in units of hundreds of kilometres. Very few individuals remain at the release sites. Survival of translocated animals have occasionally been shown to be poor, often as a result of the large movements.

In Namibia, private land managers still trap cheetahs but increasingly consider moving animals instead of killing them. Across Africa, managers have translocated perceived conflict carnivores for decades, but rarely evaluated their actions. We analyse the outcomes of 15 cheetah translocations (for 23 adults and 10 dependent offspring) into free-range environments in Namibia. We released cheetahs at an average distance of 419.6 km ± 216.1 km SD (range: 71--816 km) after captive periods ranging from 1--1,184 days (350.6 days ± 439.0 days SD). An individual{\rq}s ability to survive the first year predominantly determined the overall translocation success of 40\%. Post-release conflict and homing had less impact on success. Cheetah survival was lowest in the first three months after release. Human persecution (50\% of deaths) and spotted hyaenas (29\% of deaths) had the highest effect on survival. The degree of habituation to humans acquired during captivity significantly influenced chances of survival. Cheetahs surviving the initial post-release period (∼90 days) often settled into ranges and females reproduced successfully. However, all individuals exhibited extensive movements, frequently roaming >4,000 km2 in the first six months after release (with a maximum of 19,743 km2 in 112 days), resulting in low release site fidelity. Soft release and larger recipient area size did not improve site fidelity. Based on these outcomes, we evaluated which unfenced conservation areas in Namibia could potentially receive cheetahs. We found that there are currently few public and/or private reserves large enough to contain the movement profiles we observed in this study. This suggests that most translocations will result in cheetahs re-entering farmlands where they face a high risk of persecution. In conclusion, translocations into unconfined areas can successfully conserve individual cheetahs. Due to high mortality and unpredictable outcomes, however, conservation efforts need to focus on improving tolerance of cheetahs in commercial livestock and game farming areas in order to reduce the number of indiscriminately trapped animals.",

Large carnivore translocation is one such strategy but it has shown limited success. Many reported examples used methods that likely contributed to their failure. We conducted six leopard (Panthera pardus) translocations (three males, three females) within Namibia to test specific criteria for improved protocols. We moved leopards 402.7 km (SD = 279.6 km, range 47--754 km). Overall translocation success, using strict criteria, was 67 \% and increased to 83 \% when post-release conflict was not considered in this assessment. Four individuals successfully established new territories after exploratory periods of \2 months. One female died in a road accident shortly after release and a male resumed killing livestock that were illegally herded within a protected area. Both surviving females produced cubs---the ultimate sign of success. When compared with resident leopards (six males, six females), translocated individuals showed no significant difference in range behaviour, survivorship or likelihood of conflict. At their capture sites, livestock depredation ceased for a minimum of 16 months, thus at least temporarily alleviating conflict. We used our successful protocol to develop a translocation suitability model for determining appropriate release sites. For Namibia, this model predicts potential recipient habitat of 117,613 km2, an area sufficient to support up to 87 leopard translocations. Where alternative conservation strategies have failed and managers decide to proceed with translocations, we recommend the application of our conservative protocol to identify the most suitable recipient locations. Our study demonstrates the potential value of translocation under specific circumstances and as part of a larger conflict management repertoire.

	abstract = "Most human---bear conflicts are caused by surprise encounters and bear use of human foods. Investigated were repellents and deterrents with the potential to reduce conflicts. Repellents were tested on 5 captive black bears (Ursus americanus) and 1 captive grizzly bear (U. arctos) as the bears charged or approached humans. Tested were Halt (capsaicin product). Bear Skunker (simulated skunk spray). Shield (mace product), an air horn, railroad flares, a quickly-opened umbrella, and taped music and bear sounds. Most bears were repelled by Halt or a Bear Skunker/HaIt combination. Bears repelled during a test were less likely to be aggressive during the next test. Certain bears that seemed inherently non-aggressive were frequently repelled by stimuli that incited charges by more aggressive individuals. Also discussed are intention movements by bears, and similar movements by humans that appeared to have signal value for bears. Repellents were delivered to 2 black bears and 2 grizzly bear cubs, aimed at aversively conditioning the bears to avoid humans. These bears were subsequently released into the wild. None is known to have caused further problems or to have been killed through hunting or control actions. Important contributing factors may have been the non-aggressive temperament of each of the bears and the timing of their release. Deterrents and repellents were tested on approximately 31 free-ranging black bears visiting baits at a sanitary landfill. Tests of taste and odor deterrents included ammonia, male and female human urine, mothballs. Bear Skunker, Boundry (dog deterrent), and Technichem (bear deterrent). Full strength Parson''s ammonia and male human urine placed on baits deterred most bears from eating; only ammonia appeared to deter many bears from approaching baits. Pain-inducing repellents triggered by remote control were Bear Skunker and Halt. Halt repelled most bears from the site temporarily. Test responses were the result of the effect of a stimulus on the individual bear, dominance activities by other bears at the site, and the availibility of natural foods in the area. Certain bears appeared to tolerate the more noxious deterrents or returned repeatedly following tests of the triggered repellents.

Naturalists who recognized its role in Batesian mimicry originally described it, however. Harmless butterflies mimicked the eye-catching colors and patterns of toxic butterflies, in order to avoid predation by birds. Early in life, most adult birds had become ill after eating the toxic butterflies and had acquired CTAs to them. Once a taste aversion developed, even the visual characteristics of the prey elicited avoidance by the predator. Pros: Inexpensive Safe for humans Non-lethal to consumers No Negative Environmental Impact Long-lasting Compatible with most husbandry methods Trained territorial predators ``protect'' livestock Cons: Taste specific Not an overnight solution Human factors, logistical and political Misapplication not neutral Incompatible with lethal predator removal Application is not a once in a lifetime endeavor.Like any other method of husbandry and management, it requires consistency. Applications should be made in anticipation of periods when predator losses will be highest due to females feeding young, lambing or calving seasons, etc. Every effort should be made to treat or dispose of any carcass. Untreated carcasses are free food and will only teach inexperienced predators to develop a taste for livestock.

	abstract = "Lethal methods of controlling wildlife foraging damage may present difficulties regarding conservation, ethics, welfare, and efficacy, providing an imperative to develop non-lethal alternatives. Learned food aversions offer a benign, targeted alternative to culling. However, food aversions are more readily associated with taste than with non-taste cues, and successful management applications have been limited primarily to reducing (bird) damage to treated items. To determine whether untreated foods might be protected without becoming damaged through sampling (tasting), we tested the role of an odour cue in learned food aversions with wild mammals using three conditioning treatments: (a) a combination of ziram (aversive agent) and clove oil (novel odour); (b) ziram; (c) clove oil. We tested two predictions: (1) ziram will produce learned aversion towards untreated foods; (2) training with the ziram--clove combination will produce enhanced aversion towards untreated foods in the presence of a clove odour cue. We collected detailed behavioural data from free-ranging animals using video surveillance. With European badgers Meles meles, both ziram treatments invoked innate aversion to baits. Ziram did not produce learned aversion to untreated foods, but conditioning badgers with the ziram--clove combination produced learned aversion towards untreated foods in the presence of the odour cue. The clove control did not affect badger behaviour. Our results support the second, but not the first, prediction with badgers. Red foxes Vulpes vulpes attended the ziram and the clove treatments only. Foxes displayed innate aversion to ziram, and subsequently developed learned aversions to untreated baits. Our results with foxes therefore support the first prediction, but we were unable to test the second. Learned food aversions using odour cues could potentially provide non-lethal protection for untreated foodstuffs, such as eggs, crops, and fruit, from mammalian pest species.

	abstract = "The most traditional method where livestock guarding dogs (LGDs) are used is that they follow the sheep and their herder around the grazing areas. The intensity of shepherding is usually dependant upon factors such as herd size, flocking abilities of the sheep breed, terrain, vegetation, and predator density. LGDs may also work alone either with free roaming sheep or in enclosed pastures. The principle of livestock guarding by dogs is based upon a strong social bonding between dogs and sheep. By rearing the pup together with sheep from the age of 6 weeks, and with restricted human contact, the dog will perceive the sheep as pack members, which it will defend if necessary. The economy of sheep farming in Norway is based up on extensive management procedures using rough grazing during summer (usually forest or alpine tundra habitats), most often with supervision of the animals only once a week. The sheep tend to graze widely dispersed in small family groups. A pre-requirement for an effective livestock guarding by dogs is that the sheep are flocking, as a dog cannot guard sheep that are widely scattered, thus making use of traditional LGD methods in Norway difficult. If LGDs are to be used in Norway, sheep need to be herded or kept within a fenced pasture. Alternative methods: (M1) LGDs used in combination with herding and use of night corrals; (M2) LGDs on fenced pastures; (M3) LGDs alone with sheep on open range; (M4) LGDs loose on patrol together with a range inspector.",

@article{Montag_2003,
	abstract = {This paper attempts to discuss the suggested limitations that are associated with compensation programs that pay for livestock depredation. While supporters argue that compensation programs for livestock depredation are a good investment of public and private funds, others suggest that there are limitations inherent to compensation programs. The discussion of limitations help to show the complexity of the compensation issue and indicate that limitations impact all compensation types (public authorities may utilize the following methods: direct compensation, insurance, compensation funds; nongovernmental organizations may administer compensation programs; and individual producers may take out insurance (de Klemm 1996)). These limitations can be framed in the following four key realms: 1 unanticipated negative consequences, 2 policy, responsibility, and roles, 3 urban versus rural values, and 4 concerns that compensation doesn{\rq}t address. E.g. 1. Expectations created: not met - farmers more negative towards predators. e.g. paid less than final market value for young livestock if it survived; no compensation for missing livestock/unconfirmed predator kills; compensation for specific predator depredations cause that predator to be blamed; too high payments: better to lose livestock to predators than to market! (perverse incentive); slow payment might make farmes negative to predators and conservation organizations; financial burden too great for compensating organizations... leading to failed expectations. 2. Predators belong to "nobody" (the public?). So who is responsible for damages? In Namibia, farmers have the right to "self-defence". But when predators become protected (because threatened)? Is it affordable for the state? 3. Urban majority decide for the rural minority, who have to live with the consequences... social issues not addressed by compensation. 4. Human safety concerns; predator effects on game not addressed; livestock more than just money, farmers feel personally responsible for their livestock. Much of this discussion about compensation has been dominated by well-intentioned conservationists, but we{\rq}re lagging behind in incorporating and understanding those that compensation is supposed to serve. They may see it, not as an economic issue, but as a federal government issue, as a private rights issue, an equity issue, a public grazing issue, a public land management issue, or even a private land management issue, or frame it as a combination of many issues, specific to their social and political contexts. Compensation may be viewed as a useful tool, but one with limitations and possible unanticipated adverse consequences. Ultimately, whether compensation can contribute to carnivore conservation depends on the nature of and the understanding of the community for which it is to serve.},

@article{Lukarevsky_2003,
	abstract = "The Central Asian leopard (Panthera pardus tullianusciscaucasica), was spread found throughout all of the mountains of Turkmenistan, southern Uzbekistan, and southwestern Tajikistan, as well as parts of the Caucasus. Although the former range of the leopard in these regions stretched for several million hectares, today such habitats are confined to less than 600,000 to 800,000 hectares. But in the case of the leopard, the problem is not just diminishing habitat and food sources, but poaching, especially in retribution for killing livestock. Planning a strategy for protecting animals like the leopard must therefore take into account the life of people whom the animals encounter. The law on endangered species of Turkmenistan clearly states that punishment for killing protected species must be accompanied by an incentive to protect them. Simply declaring the animal a protected species can actually have an opposite and undesired effect, making the cats a target for poaching and a prize on the black market. Moreover, in densely populated regions where leopards regularly attack the very livestock people depend on for their livelihood, legal restrictions are ineffective due to the stronger influence of economic factors. Taking these factors into account, an experiment organized with funding from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has developed a new approach to coexistence between the leopard and local populations. I was so impressed by the team WWF had composed, especially the fact that it included members of the local community. For me, the most unexpected aspect of our work was the attitude of local residents, who actively participated in planning a strategy for leopard conservation. Our plan involved compensating local ranchers with live animals, in essence materially replacing any animal killed by a leopard. Using the money WWF provided, we bought 196 sheep, which subsequently became the property of the Catena Ecoclub. The wisdom of this strategy lay not only in involving local people directly in its planning and realization, but also in the far-sighted use of financial resources. Regardless of the initial generosity of a donor, sooner or later the money will dry up. Thus we needed to find a sustainable way to manage the funding. Under proper management, a flock of sheep is capable of reproducing and growing in size virtually on its own. A flock of 650-700 sheep would grow on its own and cover the cost of paying shepherds and veterinarians. We invited 40 of the most respected and influential ranchers in the region to take part in a seminar, where we explained our idea and asked for help in implementing it. In response, several ranchers voiced their desire to insure their herds against leopard attacks, and a council was elected to manage the newly formed flock for one year. We also decided that eventually the flock -- and the responsibilities that accompanied it -- would become the property of a soon-to-be-formed Kara-Kala Ranchers{\rq} Society. The council chose two experts to investigate cases of supposed leopard attacks. Ranchers who lost livestock were given a set period of time to register the attack with one of the experts, who would determine not only whether or not it was indeed a leopard who had killed the animal, but also whether the rancher{\rq}s herd was being properly managed at the time.",

Decades of intensive study have yet to discern the actual mechanisms behind observed global patterns. Here, by integrating the predictions from multiple theories into a single model and using data from 126 grassland plots spanning five continents, we detect the clear signals of numerous underlying mechanisms linking productivity and richness. We find that an integrative model has substantially higher explanatory power than traditional bivariate analyses. In addition, the specific results unveil several surprising findings that conflict with classical model. These include the isolation of a strong and consistent enhancement of productivity by richness, an effect in striking contrast with superficial data patterns. Also revealed is a consistent importance of competition across the full range of productivity values, in direct conflict with some (but not all) proposed models. The promotion of local richness by macroecological gradients in climatic favourability, generally seen as a competing hypothesis, is also found to be important in our analysis.

	abstract = "In Alberta, Canada (1982--2001), and in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, United States (1987--2001), wolves ( Canis lupus) killed various domestic animals, among which the major prey were sheep in the United States (68\%, n = 494) and cattle in Canada (95\%; n = 1633). Under recovery programs, the wolf population increased in the United States, and depredation events increased proportionately. In both countries, the number of domestic animals killed each year was correlated with the number of wolves killed by government authorities for depredation management. We tested the ability of antiwolf barriers made of flags hanging from ropes to impede wolf access to food and livestock. In 18 experiments, barriers prevented captive wolves (n = 9) from accessing food for up to 28 hours and allowed daily separation of wolves to administer contraceptive pills to a female wolf. Barriers prevented access by wild wolves to 100-m2 baited sites during two 60-day tests. We also set barriers around three cattle pastures. In Alberta during two 60-day trials on 25-ha pastures, wolves approached barriers on 23 occasions but did not cross them, and no cattle were killed. Wolves killed cattle on neighboring ranches during the trials and before and after the trials on the tested ranches. In Idaho four radiocollared wolves crossed barriers and killed cattle in a 400-ha ranch after 61 days of barrier exposure. Our results suggest that antiwolf barriers are effective in deterring captive and wild wolves for >1 and ≥60 days, respectively, and that wild wolves switch to alternative livestock when excluded from one herd of livestock. Our depredation data indicate that protecting livestock from wolves reduces the necessity for killing wolves. Barriers could play a role among the limited set of preventive measures available and offer a cost-effective mitigation tool for the problem of livestock depredation on a local scale.",

The influential {\lq}environmental jackal narrative{\rq} that lethal control is undesirable and ineffective, is rooted in the science of predator ecology but the linked recommendation that farmers learn to {\lq}live with the jackal{\rq} is on less solid ground. The rival {\lq}farmer jackal narrative{\rq} that jackal populations need to be suppressed on agricultural land resonates with conservation theories justifying the culling of jackals in national parks.

	abstract = "The African leopard Panthera pardus pardus is an apex predator, and a reliable indicator of a healthy ecosystem. Currently assessed as ̳near threatened{\lq} by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, leopards are exposed to a range of threats that include: habitat loss and/or degradation, depletion of natural prey, conflict with people, consumptive- and non-consumptive practices, and the illegal trade of leopard products. Leopards have disappeared from 37\% of their historical range, and are continuing to decline. Leopards have been extirpated across many areas of Africa, especially where people are densely populated, which has left patchily distributed leopard populations throughout the continent---to date, an accurate census has never been achieved. A variety of management techniques and conservation schemes are used in an attempt to mitigate threats directed at leopards; for example: (1) improved livestock husbandry that reduces livestock depredation and thus reduces retaliatory killing of the supposed offender---often thought to be the leopard, (2) designing community-based conservation schemes that benefit local people (i.e., food, money, jobs, ownership), (3) financial compensation for livestock losses, (4) ecotourism and regulated sport hunting, and (5) ratification of conservation-orientated government policies. Detailed, long-term leopard research began in the 1970{\lq}s, and continues to the present day with many peer-reviewed papers focusing primarily on their ecology within savannah ecosystems. Technological advances (e.g., GPS tracking collars and remote camera traps) are helping to further our knowledge of leopard demographics, intra- and inter-specific interactions, predation, habitat use, and effective monitoring techniques. Nevertheless, more research is desperately required if leopard populations are to persist within human-dominated landscapes, like continental Africa.

	abstract = "Estimation of survival rates is important for developing and evaluating conservation options for large carnivores. However, telemetry studies for large carnivores are often characterized by small sample sizes that limit meaningful conclusions. We used data from 10 published and 8 unpublished studies of leopards Panthera pardus in southern Africa to estimate survival rates and investigate causes of leopard mortality. Mean survival rates were significantly lower in non-protected (0.55 ± SE 0.08) compared to protected areas (0.88 ± 0.03). Inside protected areas juveniles had significantly lower survival (0.39 ± 0.10) compared to subadults (0.86 ± 0.07) and adults (0.88 ± 0.04). There was a greater difference in cause of death between protected and non-protected areas for females compared to males, with people being the dominant cause of mortality outside protected areas for both females and males. We suggest there is cause for concern regarding the sustainability of leopard populations in South Africa, as high female mortality may have severe demographic effects and a large proportion of suitable leopard habitat lies in non-protected areas. However, because a large proportion of deaths outside protected areas were attributed to deliberate killing by people, we suggest that management interventions may have the potential to increase leopard survival dramatically. We therefore stress the urgency to initiate actions, such as conflict mitigation programmes, to increase leopard survival in non-protected areas.",

	abstract = "Human-carnivore conflict continues to present a major conservation challenge around the world. Translocation of large carnivores is widely implemented but remains strongly debated, in part because of a lack of cost transparency. We report detailed translocation costs for three large carnivore species in Namibia and across different translocation scenarios. We consider the effect of various parameters and factors on costs and translocation success. Total translocation cost for 30 individuals in 22 events was $80,681 (US Dollars). Median translocation cost per individual was $2,393, and $2,669 per event. Median cost per cheetah was $2,760 (n = 23), and $2,108 per leopard (n = 6). One hyaena was translocated at a cost of $1,672. Tracking technology was the single biggest cost element (56\%), followed by captive holding and feeding. Soft releases, prolonged captivity and orphaned individuals also increased case-specific costs. A substantial proportion (65.4\%) of the total translocation cost was successfully recovered from public interest groups. Less than half the translocations were confirmed successes (44.4\%, 3 unknown) with a strong species bias. Four leopards (66.7\%) were successfully translocated but only eight of the 20 cheetahs (40.0\%) with known outcome met these strict criteria. None of the five habituated cheetahs was translocated successfully, nor was the hyaena. We introduce the concept of Individual Conservation Cost (ICC) and define it as the cost of one successfully translocated individual adjusted by costs of unsuccessful events of the same species. The median ICC for cheetah was $6,898 and $3,140 for leopard. Translocations are costly, but we demonstrate that they are not inherently more expensive than other strategies currently employed in non-lethal carnivore conflict management. We conclude that translocation should be one available option for conserving large carnivores, but needs to be critically evaluated on a case-by-case basis.",

	abstract = "The herbivorous animals and pastures of an undisturbed natural community are described. The latter are classified into four main series, namely, the valley grasslands, the alkaline lake shore grasslands, the wooded grasslands and the annual grass associations in the Acacia parkland. The grazing calendar of the eight commonest animals (elephant, buffalo, hippopotamus, puku, topi, zebra, bohor reedbuck, and eland) is recorded. The value of the various pastures at different times of the year is noted and the special importance of the dry-season growth of perennial grasses after burning or trampling is emphasized. It has been observed that animals feeding on green pasture do not need to drink, even during the hot season, provided they have access to shade. The effect which large herds or heavy animals have in keeping the pastures in a favorable state is noted, and the dependance of one grazing species on another is mentioned; some other species with rather different feeding habits do not usually cooperate fully in this grazing program. The significance of the alternating seasons of flood and drought on both the herbage and the animals is stressed and the effects of the animals on the pastures, and of the seasons on both the herbage and the animals, are described. It is is shown that the pastures are rested at certain seasons and that stocking is conditioned by such factors as the availability of water or shade, or by the extent of flooding, and not by the total area of the habitat. A census of the animals present was attempted and the methods employed are described. The figures arrived at are summarized and, although the stock seems small in relation to the total area, it is thought to be balanced in relation to limits set by the alternating periods of flood and drought. The implications of these limiting factors are considered and suggestions are made as to how the carrying capacity of a similar area might be improved.",

Current efforts to incorporate stakeholder engagement typically do not fully acknowledge or address the social conflicts that lie beneath the surface of conservation issues, nor do they consistently create the necessary conditions for productive transformation of the root causes of conflict. Yet, the ultimate level of social carrying capacity for many species will depend on the extent to which conservation can reconcile these social conflicts, thereby increasing social receptivity to conservation goals. To this end, conservation conflict transformation (CCT) offers a new perspective on, and approach to, how conservationists identify, understand, prevent, and reconcile conflict. Principles and processes from the peacebuilding field inform CCT and offer useful guidance for revealing and addressing social conflicts to improve the effectiveness of conservation efforts. The Human-Wildlife Conflict Collaboration (HWCC) has adapted and demonstrated these principles for application in conservation through capacity building and conflict interventions, transforming how many practitioners in the conservation field address conflict. In this article, we discuss current limitations of practice when addressing conflict in conservation, define conflict transformation, illustrate two analytical models to orient the reader to the benefits of CCT, and present two case studies where CCT was applied usefully to a conservation-related conflict.",

	abstract = {In addition to economic, technological, religious, and ideological resitence to new discoveries, science itself often resists new discoveries. This article investigate the elements within science that limit openmindedness. "Scientists are also human beings" is often used as an excuse, looking at psychological bias of personality, but without considering cultural and sciological reasons for the resitence against new discoveries. Planck said that "This experience (of resistence to his ideas), gave me also an opportunity to learn a new fact a remarkable one, in my opinion: A new scientific truth does not triumph by cconvincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because it's opponents eventually dies and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it". 1. Cultural blinders are one constant source of resistance to innovations. 2. Substantive current scientific theories has been an important source of resistance to, for example, Pasteur's discovery of the biological character of fermentation. " Because of their substantive conceptions and theories, scientists sometimes miss discoveries that are literally right before their eyes." 3. Methodological conceptions. E.g. preference for the evidence of the senses; to think in terms of established models and to reject what cannot be put in the form of some model, so models can be both useful and asource of blindness; the usefulness (or not) of mathematics (and statistics), e.g. prejudice against mathematics in biology. 4. Religious ideas of scientists themselves. 5. Professional standing and patterns of social interactions among scientists. E.g. Mendel. 6. Professional specialization and rejections of innovation by "outsiders" to a field of specialization. 7. Societies, "schools" and seniority. Huxley: " "'Authorities,' 'disciples,' and 'schools' are the curse of science; and do more to interfere with the work of the scientiSc spirit than all its enemies". The older often resist the younger. High honours for past accolplishments do not like progress proving them wrong.},

@book{Barber_2015,
	abstract = "The last decade has seen considerable growth in interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. In the broadest sense, these fields aim to {\lq}learn something useful{\rq} about the environment within which the organism operates. How gathered information is processed leads to the development of algorithms -- how to process high dimensional data and deal with uncertainty. In the early stages of research in Machine Learning and related areas, similar techniques were discovered in relatively isolated research communities. Whilst not all techniques have a natural description in terms of probability theory, many do, and it is the framework of Graphical Models (a marriage between graph and probability theory) that has enabled the understanding and transference of ideas from statistical physics, statistics, machine learning and information theory. To this extent it is now reasonable to expect that machine learning researchers are familiar with the basics of statistical modelling techniques. This book concentrates on the probabilistic aspects of information processing and machine learning. Certainly no claim is made as to the correctness or that this is the only useful approach. Indeed, one might counter that this is unnecessary since ``biological organisms don{\rq}t use probability theory''. Whether this is the case or not, it is undeniable that the framework of graphical models and probability has helped with the explosion of new algorithms and models in the machine learning community. One should also be clear that Bayesian viewpoint is not the only way to go about describing machine learning and information processing. Bayesian and probabilistic techniques really come into their own in domains where uncertainty is a necessary consideration. The structure of the book One aim of part I of the book is to encourage Computer Science students into this area. A particular difficulty that many modern students face is a limited formal training in calculus and linear algebra, meaning that minutiae of continuous and high-dimensional distributions can turn them away. In beginning with probability as a form of reasoning system, we hope to show the reader how ideas from logical inference and dynamical programming that they may be more familiar with have natural parallels in a probabilistic context. In particular, Computer Science students are familiar with the concept of algorithms as core. However, it is more common in machine learning to view the model as core, and how this is implemented is secondary. From this perspective, understanding how to translate a mathematical model into a piece of computer code is central. Part II introduces the statistical background needed to understand continuous distributions and how learning can be viewed from a probabilistic framework. Part III discusses machine learning topics. Certainly some readers will raise an eyebrow to see their favourite statistical topic listed under machine learning. A difference viewpoint between statistics and machine learning is what kinds of systems we would ultimately like to construct (machines capable of {\lq}human/biological information processing tasks) rather than in some of the techniques. This section of the book is therefore what I feel would be useful for machine learners to know. Part IV discusses dynamical models in which time is explicitly considered. In particular the Kalman Filter is treated as a form of graphical model, which helps emphasise what the model is, rather than focusing on it as a {\lq}filter{\rq}, as is more traditional in the engineering literature. Part V contains a brief introduction to approximate inference techniques, including both stochastic (Monte Carlo) and deterministic (variational) techniques.",

	abstract = "Humans have marvelled at the fit of form and function, the way organisms{\rq} traits seem remarkably suited to their lifestyles and ecologies. While natural selection provides the scientific basis for the fit of form and function, Darwin found certain adaptations vexing or particularly intriguing: sex ratios, sexual selection and altruism. The logic behind these adaptations resides in frequency-dependent selection where the value of a given heritable phenotype (i.e. strategy) to an individual depends upon the strategies of others. Game theory is a branch of mathematics that is uniquely suited to solving such puzzles. While game theoretic thinking enters into Darwin{\rq}s arguments and those of evolutionists through much of the twentieth century, the tools of evolutionary game theory were not available to Darwin or most evolutionists until the 1970s, and its full scope has only unfolded in the last three decades. As a consequence, game theory is applied and appreciated rather spottily. Game theory not only applies to matrix games and social games, it also applies to speciation, macroevolution and perhaps even to cancer. I assert that life and natural selection are a game, and that game theory is the appropriate logic for framing and understanding adaptations. Its scope can include behaviours within species, state-dependent strategies (such as male, female and so much more), speciation and coevolution, and expands beyond microevolution to macroevolution. Game theory clarifies aspects of ecological and evolutionary stability in ways useful to understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics, niche construction and ecosystem engineering. In short, I would like to think that Darwin would have found game theory uniquely useful for his theory of natural selection. Let us see why this is so.",

However, the uncertainties associated with MCDA techniques are inevitable and model outcomes are open to multiple types of uncertainty. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. We access the uncertainty of landslide susceptibility maps produced with GIS-MCDA techniques. A new spatially-explicit approach and Dempster--Shafer Theory (DST) are employed to assess the uncertainties associated with two MCDA techniques, namely Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) implemented in GIS. The methodology is composed of three different phases. First, weights are computed to express the relative importance of factors (criteria) for landslide susceptibility. Next, the uncertainty and sensitivity of landslide susceptibility is analyzed as a function of weights using Monte Carlo Simulation and Global Sensitivity Analysis. Finally, the results are validated using a landslide inventory database and by applying DST. The comparisons of the obtained landslide susceptibility maps of both MCDA techniques with known landslides show that the AHP outperforms OWA. However, the OWA-generated landslide susceptibility map shows lower uncertainty than the AHP-generated map. The results demonstrate that further improvement in the accuracy of GIS-based MCDA can be achieved by employing an integrated uncertainty--sensitivity analysis approach, in which the uncertainty of landslide susceptibility model is decomposed and attributed to model0 s criteria weights.",

This means that, given the values assumed by a selection of variables, the possibility that a subsequent variable assumes some value only depends on the value taken by the most recent variable of the selection. The one-step transition possibilities are recovered by computing the conditional possibility of any two consecutive variables. Under the behavioural interpretation as marginal betting rates against events these 'conditional'possibilities and the initial possibilities should satisfy the rationality criteria of 'avoiding sure loss' and 'coherence'. We sho that this is indeed the case when the conditional possibilities are defined using Dempster's conditioning rule. The results show that it is possible to work with imprecise probabilities in modelling Markov processes. Scondly they indicate that Dempster's conditioning rule is of special importance in a specifically possibilistic context, for two reasons: 1) it is the most specific (or least conservative, or most committal) conditioning rule that is coherent in the context of possibilistic Markov processes; and 2) it is very easy to work with, which makes a possibilistic theory of Markov processes computationally tractable.",

We ued lynx Lynx canadensis as our focal species, and developed our environmental relationship model using track data collected in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada, during winters from 1997 to 2000. The accuracy of the three spatial models were compared using a contingency table method. We determined the percentage of cases in which both presence and absence points were correctly classified (overal accuracy), the failure to predict a species where it occurred (omission error) and the prediction of presence where there was absence (commission error). Our overal accuracy showed the logistic regression approach was the most accurate (74.51\%). The multiples criteria evaluation was intermediate (39.22\%), while Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory model was the poorest (29.90\%). However, omission and commisision error tell us a different story: logistic regression had the lowest commission erre, while D-S produced the lowest omission error. Our results provide evidence that habitat modellers should evaluate all three error measires when ascribing confidence in their model. We suggest that for our study area at least, the logistic regression model is optimal. However, where sample size is small or the species is very rare, it may also be useful to explore and/or use a more ecologically cautious modelling approach (e.g. Dempster-Shafer) that would over-predict, protect more sites, and therby minimize the risk of missing critical habitat in conservation plans.",

We derive the Kalman Filter from this equation using a novel method to evaluate the Chapman-Kolmogorov prediction integral. We then use the theory to fuse data from multiple sensors. Vying with this approach is Dempster-Shafer theory, which deals with measures of ``belief'', and is based on the nonclassical idea of ``mass'' as opposed to probability. Although these two measures look very similar, there are some differences. We point them out through outlining the ideas of Dempster-Shafer theory and presenting the basic Dempster-Shafer fusion equation. Finally we compare the two methods, and discuss the relative merits and demerits using an illustrative example. 1) Bayes: Probability vs DS: Knowledge/Belief 2) DS allows explicitly for an undecided state of our knowledge. 3) Probablity (BN) better understood and accepted. 4) DS calculations longer and more involved than BN (but can sometimes perform better).",

In this paper, we advocate the Bayesian paradigm as a broader framework for multimodel inference, one in which model averaging and model selection are naturally linked, and in which the performance of AIC-based tools is naturally evaluated. Prior model weights implicitly associated with the use of AIC are seen to highly favor complex models: in some cases, all but the most highly parameterized models in the model set are virtually ignored a priori. We suggest the usefulness of the weighted BIC (Bayesian information criterion) as a computationally simple alternative to AIC, based on explicit selection of prior model probabilities rather than acceptance of default priors associated with AIC. We note, however, that both procedures are only approximate to the use of exact Bayes factors. We discuss and illustrate technical difficulties associated with Bayes factors, and suggest approaches to avoiding these difficulties in the context of model selection for a logistic regression. Our example highlights the predisposition of AIC weighting to favor complex models and suggests a need for caution in using the BIC for computing approximate posterior model weights.",

	abstract = "The Bayesian theory has long been the predominate method in dealing with uncertainties in civil engineering practice including water resources engineering . However, it imposes unnecessary restrictive requirements on inferential problems. Concerns thus arise about the effectiveness of using Bayesian theory in dealing with more general inferential problems. The recently developed Dempster-Shafer theory appears to be able to surmount the limitations of Bayesian theory. The new theory was originally proposed as a pure mathematical theory. A reasonable amount of work has been done in trying to adopt this new theory in practice, most of this work being related to inexact inference in expert systems and all of the work still remaining in the fundamental stage. The purpose of this research is first to compare the two theories and second to try to apply Dempster-Shafer theory in solving real problems in water resources engineering. In comparing Bayesian and Dempster-Shafer theory, the equivalent situation between these two theories under a special situation is discussed first. The divergence of results from Dempster-Shafer and Bayesian approaches under more general situations where Bayesian theory is unsatisfactory is then examined. Following this, the conceptual difference between the two theoies is argued. Also discussed in the first part of this research is the issue of dealing with evidence including classifying sources of evidence and expressing them through belief functions. In attempting to adopt Dempster-Shafer theory in engineering practice, the Dempster-Shafer decision theory, i.e. the application of Dempster-Shafer theory within the framework of conventional decision theory, is introduced. The application of this new decision theory is demonstrated through a water resources engineering design example.",

The games considered are n-person games represented by means of pure strategies and pay-off functions defined for the combinations of pure strategies. The distinctions between cooperative and non-cooperative games is unrelated to the mathematical description by means of pure strategies and pay-off functions of a game. Rather, it depends on the possibility or impossibility of coalitions, communication, and side-payments. The concepts of an equilibrium point, a solution, a strong solution, a sub-solution, and values are introduced by mathematical definitions. And in later sections the interpretation of those concepts in non-cooperative games is discussed. The main mathematical result is the proof of the existence in any game of at least one equilibrium point. Other results concern the geometrical structure of the set of equilibrium points of a game with a solution, the geometry of sub-solutions, and the existence of a symmetrical equilibrium point in a symmetrical game. As an illustration of the possibilities for application a treatment of a simple three-man poker model is included.",

	abstract = {Judea Pearl is historically one of the most significant figures in the theory and practice of AI. In this essay, I{\rq}ll focus on the questions and inspirations that motivated his ground-breaking research in three major areas: heuristics, uncertain reasoning, and causality. 1. Heuristics: Observed how much people can accomplish with that simplistic, unreliable information source known as intuition. He defines heuristics as ``criteria, methods, or principles for deciding which among several alternative courses of action promises to be the most effective in order to achieve some goal.'' He asks how heuristics can be discovered. He proposes a method: consult ``simplified models of the problem domain'' particularly those ``generated by removing constraints which forbid or penalize certain moves in the original problem". 2. Uncertain reasoning: He suggests that human intuition invokes some crude form of probabilistic computation. In light of the speed and effectiveness of human reasoning, the computational difficulties that plagued earlier probabilistic systems could not be very fundamental and should be overcome by making the right choice of simplifying assumptions. Rumelhart presented compelling evidence that text comprehension must be a distributed process that combines both top-down and bottom-up inferences. He thus began to explore the possibility of achieving distributed computation in a ``pure'' Bayesian framework, so as not to compromise its basic capacity to combine bi-directional inferences (i.e., predictive and abductive). He used graphical structures to encode probabilistic information. It became clear that conditional independence is the most fundamental relation behind the organization of probabilistic knowledge. Pearl{\rq}s key insight was that beliefs about propositions and other quantities could often be regarded as ``direct causes'' of other beliefs and that these causal linkages could be used to construct the graphical structures he was interested in. Most importantly, this method of constructing them would automatically encode the key conditional independence assumptions among probabilities which he regarded as so important for simplifying probabilistic reasoning. From which came Bayesian networks and their progeny. 3. Causality: Pearl{\rq}s work on causality was inspired by his notion that beliefs could be regarded as causes of other beliefs. He came to regard ``causal relationships [as] the fundamental building blocks both of physical reality and of human understanding of that reality''. Neither logic, nor any branch of mathematics had developed adequate tools for managing problems, involving cause-effect relationships. Pearl noted most of his colleagues ``considered causal vocabulary to be dangerous, avoidable, ill-defined, and nonscientific''. The key, again, was the use of graphical causal models. It was precisely this conversion of networks and diagrams to mathematically defined objects that led to their current acceptance in practical reasoning systems.},

	abstract = "P value, which is neither as reliable nor as objective as most scientists assume. When UK statistician Ronald Fisher introduced the P value in the 1920s, he did not mean it to be a definitive test. He intended it simply as an informal way to judge whether evidence was significant in the old-fashioned sense: worthy of a second look. The idea was to run an experiment, then see if the results were consistent with what random chance might produce. Researchers would first set up a {\lq}null hypothesis{\rq} that they wanted to disprove, such as there being no correlation or no difference between two groups. Next, they would play the devil{\rq}s advocate and, assuming that this null hypothesis was in fact true, calculate the chances of getting results at least as extreme as what was actually observed. This probability was the P value. The smaller it was, suggested Fisher, the greater the likelihood that the straw-man null hypothesis was false. For all the P value{\rq}s apparent precision, Fisher intended it to be just one part of a process. An an alternative framework for data analysis included statistical power, false positives, false negatives. One result is an abundance of confusion about what the P value means. It requires a lot more evidence to supersede an everyday explanation. The more implausible the hypothesis --- telepathy, aliens, homeopathy --- the greater the chance that an exciting finding is a false alarm, no matter what the P value is. Some scinetists provide general rule-of-thumb conversions (see {\lq}Probable cause{\rq}). P values can encourage muddled thinking. A prime example is their tendency to deflect attention from the actual size of an effect. P values can encourage muddled thinking. A prime example is their tendency to deflect attention from the actual size of an effect. P-hacking; is also known as data-dredging, snooping, fishing, significance-chasing and double-dipping. ``P-hacking, is trying multiple things until you get the desired result''. Researchers should always report effect sizes and confidence intervals. Many statisticians also advocate replacing the P value with methods that take advantage of Bayes{\rq} rule. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses should be approached differently and clearly labelled. There are three questions a scientist might want to ask after a study: {\lq}What is the evidence?{\rq} {\lq}What should I believe?{\rq} and {\lq}What should I do?{\rq} One method cannot answer all these questions.",

	abstract = "This paper examines the applicability of belief functions methodology in three reasoning tasks: (1) representation of incomplete knowledge, (2) belief updating, and (3) evidence pooling. We find that belief functions have difficulties representing incomplete knowledge, primarily knowledge expressed in conditional sentences. In this context, we also show that the prevailing practices of encoding if-then rules as belief function expressions are inadequate, as they lead to counterintuitive conclusions under chaining, contraposition, and reasoning by cases. Next, we examine the role of belief functions in updating states of belief and find that, if partial knowledge is encoded and updated by belief function methods, the updating process violates basic patterns of plausibility and the resulting beliefs cannot serve as a basis for rational decisions. Finally, assessing their role in evidence pooling, we find that belief functions offer a rich language for describing the evidence gathered, highly compatible with the way people summarize observations. However, the methods available for integrating evidence into a coherent state of belief capable of supporting plausible decisions cannot make use of this richness and are challenged by simpler methods based on likelihood functions.

The capability for bidirectional inferences, combined with a rigorous probabilistic foundation, led to the rapid emergence of Bayesian networks as the method of choice for uncertain reasoning in AI and expert systems. The most important aspect of a Bayesian networks is that they are direct representations of the world, not of reasoning processes. Reasoning processes can operate on Bayesian networks by propagating information in any direction (prediction, abduction, explaining away). Their usefulness include: 1) Probabilistic semantics (Any complete probabilistic model of a domain must, either explicitly or implicitly, represent the joint distribution|the probability of every possible event as de ned by the values of all the variables. There are exponentially many such events, yet Bayesian networks achieve compactness by factoring the joint distribution into local, conditional distributions for each variable given its parents. The number of parameters required grows only linearly with the size of the network, whereas the joint distribution itself grows exponentially.), 2) Evidential reasoning, 3) Uncertainty over time (Entities that live in a changing environment must keep track of variables whose values change over time. Dynamic Bayesian networks capture this process by representing multiple copies of the state variables, one for each time step), 4) Learning in Bayesian networks (The conditional probabilities P (xi jpai) can be updated continuously from observational data using gradient-based or EM methods), 5) Causal networks (Most probabilistic models, including general Bayesian networks, describe a distribution over possible observed events, but say nothing about what will happen if a certain intervention occurs. A causal network, intuitively speaking, is a Bayesian network with the added property that the parents of each node are its direct causes. Causal networks are more properly defined, then, as Bayesian networks in which the correct probability model after intervening to fix any node's value is given simply by deleting links from the node's parents), 6) Functional Bayesian networks (To process counterfactual information. counterfactual probabilities require a specification in the form of functional networks, where each conditional probability P( xi|pai ) is replaced by a functional relationship xi = fi(pai, ei) where ei is a stochastic (unobserved) error term), 7) Causal discovery (The possibility of using Bayesian networks to discover causal structures in raw statistical data. Certain patterns of dependency, which are totally void of temporal information, are conceptually characteristic of certain causal directionalities and not others. When put together systematically, such patterns can be used to infer causal structures from raw data), 8) Plain beliefs (Bayesian networks can be adopted to model the dynamics of plain beliefs by replacing ordinary probabilities with non-standard probabilities, that is, probabilities that are infinitesimally close to either zero or one), 9) Models of cognition (Bayesian networks may be viewed as normative cognitive models of propositional reasoning under uncertainty).",

	abstract = "Scientific orthodoxy based on the acquired authority of some scientists has seriously hampered the progress of the natural sciences in the past and continues to do so today because of new societal influences, such as directive funding and political interference in the setting of research objectives. Enhancing the progress of science must continue to be an important priority in order to meet the future needs of mankind. Yet priority setting between different branches of research is currently controversial because of the limited availability of funds and the political interference. For sound priority setting, an adequate level of scientific literacy is required among policy makers, a subject that will attract attention throughout this paper. The ``introduction'' gives an overview of the issues at stake. Prevailing pessimistic views of the future of our complex society are viewed as being similar to a medieval doomsday syndrome. Pathways to a new renaissance and age of reason are suggested. Three major recommendations are made: (i) Freedom of inquiry must be protected; (ii) The political misuse of potential environmental scares needs to be investigated before doomsday predictions alarm public perceptions and hence shape policies; (iii) The search for excellence in the leadership of science should be emphasized because it should not be based largely on acquired authority. The current controversy over possible impacts of rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere on climate is analyzed as a case study.",

Savage based his argument on a set of postulates for rational behaviour. Empirical research during the past three decades has shown that people often violate these postulates, but it is widely believed that this is irrelevant to Savage's argument. This article re-examines Savage's argument and concludes that his postulates cannot be so thoroughly insulated from the empirical facts. The argument actually relies heavily on assumptions that have been empirically refuted. Savage's normative interpretation of subjective expected utility must therefore be revised. The revision suggested here emphasizes the constructive nature of probability and preference. It also emphasizes the constructive nature of small worlds, the framework within which probability and utility judgements are made. According to the constructive understanding, an analysis of a decision problem by subjective expected utility is merely an argument, an argument that compares that decision problem to the decision problem of a gambler in a pure game of chance. This argument by analogy may or may not be cogent. In some cases other arguments are more cogent.",

	abstract = "This essay is in part a defense and in part a reformulation of earlier work by A.P. DEmpster. The ideas in it were inspired by my study of Dempster's work - a study that began when I attended his seminar on statistical inference at Harvards in the spring of 1971; and it cumilates, in \#4 with a justification of some of his methods of assessing statistical evidence. But, quite naturally, it differes in important respects from Dempster's work. Most importantly, my philosophical account differes from Dempster's own. For far from rejecting the Lalacean synthesis, Dempster saw it as the source of 'much of the motivation and fascination of the modern science of probability'. And instead of thinking hos lower probabilities as degrees of belief or or degrees of support, he preferred, at least originally, to think of his upper and lower probabilities as bounds for some true but somehow unknowable probabilities, thus retaining the identification of degrees of belief with additative probabilities. The mathematical account in \#3 also also differs from Dempster's earlier account. The differences derive mainly from the replacement of multi-valued mappings by allocations of probability and from the isolation of the notion of condensability - innovations that permit the role of the commonality numbers to be fully developed. Finally, the degrees of plausibility adduced in \#4 overlap with but are not identical with the upper probabilities adduced in Dempster's papers. Thos obtained by the simplicial method in \#4.3 are identical with the upper probabilities produced by Dempster's 'structures of the second kind'. Those obtained by the linear method in \#4.2 are not discussed in any of Dempster's published work, though he has privately encouraged interest in the method. And the upper probabilities that result from Dempster's 'structures of the first kind' near no relation to the present essay - the arguments given here provide no justification for them. It is the new understanding of the meaning of Dempster's upper probabilities that I offer as the primary contribution of this essay. Since Dempster's own interpretation has not proven widely appealing, I hope that the more radical understaning of the present essay will inspire a wider interest",

	abstract = "Recognition of the relevance of the Dempster-Shafer theory to the management of uncertainty in expert systems was slow in coming. Today, it is the center of considerable attention within AI due in large measure to (a) the emergence of expert systems as one of the most significant areas of activity in knowledge engineering, and (b) the important extensions, applications and implementations of Shafer{\rq}s theory. Dempster-Shafer theory is a natural, important and useful extension of classical probability theory in which the probabilities may be assigned not just to points in the frame of discernment - which is assumed to be a finite set - but, more generally, to subsets of V. Viewed in this perspective, the Dempster-Shafer theory is closely related to the theory of random sets. The disregarding of those experts whose Li is the empty set corresponds to what is called normalization in the Dempster-Shafer theory. As we shall see at a later point, normalization can lead to highly counterintuitive results. The average normalized certainty and the average normalized possibility are, respectively, the belief and plausibilzty functions of Shafer{\rq}s theory, while the weights WI,. . ., w, are the basic probability functions of Shafer{\rq}s theory. The problem of crisp containment is the following. suppose that some particular L;, say L,, violates the containment relation, L,cA, by a very small margin. In legal terms, this may be expressed as the dictum ``reject any evidence which is not completely certain.'' A basic result in the Dempster-Shafer theory which is of direct relevance to the management of uncertainty in expert systems is the so-called Dempster{\rq}s rule of combination. As is pointed out in Zadeh (1979a), the Dempster rule of combination of evidence may lead to counterintuitive conclusions as a result of the application of normalization. Classical probability techniques are not directly applicable to the derivation of rules of combination of evidence in a rigorous framework, largely because in a typical expert system there are many gaps in the knowledge of the conditional probabilities. Thus it becomes necessary to rely on the assumption of independence or, more or less equivalently, on the maximum entropy principle, to fill the gaps with synthetic information. The Dempster-Shafer theory suggest an alternative approach in which the incompleteness of information in the knowledge base propagates to the conclusion and results in an interval-valued or, more generally, a possibilistic answer. The theory does not address the issue of chaining, nor does it come to grips with the fuzziness of probabilities and certainty factors. Although not easy to understand, Shafer{\rq}s book contains a wealth of significant results. and is a must for anyone who wants to do serious research on problems relating to the rules of combination of evidence in expert systems.",

	abstract = "A catchment area at the Zagros Mountains, NW Shiraz, Iran is selected as a test site to comparing the output results of the Dempster--Shafer (D--S) and fuzzy models in landslide hazard mapping. Lithology, slope angle, slope aspect, land cover, and soil depth were considered as landslide causal factors. The factor maps were input into a GIS and a modified landslide hazard evaluation factor (MLHEF) rating and fuzzy membership functions as well as belief function values were assessed for each class of the factor maps. The fuzzy sum, product and gamma combination approaches were examined and output maps were assessed based on the known landslides. The outputs of fuzzy sum and product combination rules were not reasonable because these approaches classified the area into {\rq}very-high{\rq} or {\rq}very low{\rq} susceptibility zones respectively, which were not compatible to the field and factor maps criteria. A c value of 0.94 yielded the most reliable susceptibility for landslides. Overlay of the known landslides with the output favorability map showed that the identified landslides were located in the high- and very-high susceptible zones. The output results of the Dempster--Shafer model: plausibility, belief, and uncertainty images were also evaluated based on the known landslides. The results of this approach revealed that although it was expected that most of the known landslides correspond the plausibility, or the belief map, only a few of them supported the case, and some landslides were coincided into the disbelief, or uncertainty maps. It is concluded that in comparison to the fuzzy model, the D--S model obtains less reliable results for landslide hazard mapping. Since the belief functions were assigned based on the fuzzy membership functions this might be due to the integration equations used by the model, or the number of evidence maps used as input layers.",

	abstract = "The Dempster-Shafer theory, also known as the theory of belief functions, is a generalization of the Bayesian theory of subjective probability. Whereas the Bayesian theory requires probabilities for each question of interest, belief functions allow us to base degrees of belief for one question on probabilities for a related question. These degrees of belief may or may not have the mathematical properties of probabilities; how much they differ from probabilities will depend on how closely the two questions are related. To illustrate the idea of obtaining degrees of belief for one question from subjective probabilities for another, suppose I have subjective probabilities for the reliability of my friend Betty. My probability that she is reliable is 0.9, and my probability that she is unreliable is 0.1. Suppose she tells me a limb fell on my car. This statement, which must true if she is reliable, is not necessarily false if she is unreliable. So her testimony alone justifies a 0.9 degree of belief that a limb fell on my car, but only a zero degree of belief (not a 0.1 degree of belief) that no limb fell on my car. This zero does not mean that I am sure that no limb fell on my car, as a zero probability would; it merely means that Betty's testimony gives me no reason to believe that no limb fell on my car. The 0.9 and the zero together constitute a belief function.",

Most impotantly, this study provides some evidence of the gulf that separates philosophy of science from science instruction, and examines some important aspects of the demarcation between science and non-science---an important issue for philosophers, scientists, and science educators.",

Our main conclusion is that although there are obvious differences in semantics, representations, and the rules for combining and marginalizing representations, there are many similarities. We claim that the two calculi have roughly the same expressive power. Each calculus has its own semantics that allow us to construct models suited for these semantics. Once we have a model in either calculus, one can transform it to the other by means of a suitable transformation. When such belief functions are converted to equivalent probability functions, they both reduce to an equally likely probability distribution. There is no coherent decision theory for the Dempster-Shafer{\rq}s theory that can take advantage of its expressiveness in representing ignorance.",

Such belief functions occur when, in a first stage, a random message is received and thenm in a second stage, a true state of nature obtains. The uncertainty about the random message in the first stage is assumed to be probablized, in agreement with Bayesian principles. For the uncertainty in the second stage no probabilities are given. The Bayesian and belief function approaches part ways in the processing of the uncertainty in the second stage. The Bayesian approach requires that this uncertainty also be probabilized, which may require a resort to subjective information.

Dempster-Shafer theory can be modeled in terms of propositional logic by the tuple (Sigma, p), where Sigma is a set of propositional clauses and p is an assignment of mass to each clause Sigma-i element of Sigma. It is shown that the disjunction of minimal support clauses for a clause Sigma-i with respect to a set Sigma of propositional clauses, Ksi(Sigma-i, Sigma), when represented in terms of symbols for the Pi's, corresponds to a symbolic representation of the Dempster-Shafer belief function for Sigma-i. The combination of Belief functions using Dempster's rule of combination corresponds to a combination of the corresponding support clauses. The disjointness of the Boolean formulas representing DS Belief functions is shown to be necessary. Methods of computing disjoint formulas using network reliability techniques are discussed. In addition, the computational complexity of deriving DS Belief functions, including that of the logic-based methods which are the focus of this paper, is explored. Because of intractability even for moderately sized problem instances, efficient approximation methods are proposed for such computations.

	abstract = "The widespread replacement of wild ungulate herbivores by domestic livestock in African savannas is composed of two interrelated phenomena: (1) loss or reduction in numbers of individual wildlife species or guilds and (2) addition of livestock to the system. Each can have important implications for plant community dynamics. Yet very few studies have experimentally addressed the individual, combined, and potentially interactive effects of wild vs. domestic herbivore species on herbaceous plant communities within a single system. Additionally, there is little information about whether, and in which contexts, livestock might functionally replace native herbivore wildlife or, alternatively, have fundamentally different effects on plant species composition. The Kenya Long-­term Exclosure Experiment, which has been running since 1995, is composed of six treatment combinations of mega-­herbivores, meso-­herbivore ungulate wildlife, and cattle. We sampled herbaceous vegetation 25 times between 1999 and 2013. We used partial redundancy analysis and linear mixed models to assess effects of herbivore treatments on overall plant community composition and key plant species. Plant communities in the six different herbivore treatments shifted directionally over time and diverged from each other substantially by 2013. Plant community composition was strongly related (R² = 0.92) to residual plant biomass, a measure of herbivore utilization. Addition of any single herbivore type (cattle, wildlife, or mega-­herbivores) caused a shift in plant community composition that was proportional to its removal of plant biomass. These results suggest that overall herbivory pressure, rather than herbivore type or complex interactions among different herbivore types, was the main driver of changes in plant community composition. Individual plant species, however, did respond most strongly to either wild ungulates or cattle. Although these results suggest considerable functional similarity between a suite of native wild herbivores (which included grazers, browsers, and mixed feeders) and cattle (mostly grazers) with respect to understory plant community composition, responses of individual plant species demonstrate that at the plant-population-­level impacts of a single livestock species are not functionally identical to those of a diverse group of native herbivores.",

Although little is known about the interplay between these mortality types, hunting of predators remains a common management strategy aimed at reducing predator-human conflict. Emerging theory and data, however, caution that such policy can alter the age structure of populations, triggering increased conflict in which conflict-prone juveniles are involved. Results: Using a 30-year dataset on human-caused cougar (Puma concolor) kills in British Columbia (BC), Canada, we examined relationships between hunter-caused and conflict-associated mortality. Individuals that were killed via conflict with humans were younger than hunted cougars. Accounting for human density and habitat productivity, human hunting pressure during or before the year of conflict comprised the most important variables. Both were associated with increased male cougar-human conflict. Moreover, in each of five regions assessed, conflict was higher with increased human hunting pressure for at least one cougar sex. Conclusion: Although only providing correlative evidence, such patterns over large geographic and temporal scales suggest that alternative approaches to conflict mitigation might yield more effective outcomes for humans as well as cougar populations and the individuals within populations.",

Understanding the ecological and anthropogenic factors that favor the predation of livestock by jaguar can help to reduce the number of attacks and thus, decrease cases of hunting in retaliation. We used field data on livestock depredation and environmental and anthropogenic variables to model the risk of depredation by jaguar along the Transamazon highway, a frontier region where ranching has been the main driver of deforestation. We used five algorithms and a final ensemble model in order to obtain a map of depredation risk, as well as to identify the variables related with it. The variables most related with depredation risk were distance to deforestation (negatively related) and cattle density (positively related). The major factors driving livestock depredation are related to anthropogenic disturbance, this means that the spatial distribution of risk is not a stable feature, but is likely to change dynamically following shifts in the deforestation frontier and in the livestock herd. Based on our results, it is reasonable to expect an increase in depredation of livestock in this area. The use of ecological niche modeling to identify potential hotspots of depredation of livestock is a recent innovation that holds potential to guide the allocation of conservation and management efforts over large areas at relatively low costs.",

	abstract = "Within a large carnivore guild, subordinate competitors (African wild dog, Lycaon pictus, and cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus) might reduce the limiting effects of dominant competitors (lion, Panthera leo, and spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta) by avoiding them in space, in time, or through patterns of prey selection. Understanding how these competitors cope with one other can inform strategies for their conservation. We tested how mechanisms of niche partitioning promote coexistence by quantifying patterns of prey selection and the use of space and time by all members of the large carnivore guild within Liuwa Plain National Park in western Zambia. Lions and hyenas specialized on wildebeest, whereas wild dogs and cheetahs selected broader diets including smaller and less abundant prey. Spatially, cheetahs showed no detectable avoidance of areas heavily used by dominant competitors, but wild dogs avoided areas heavily used by lions. Temporally, the proportion of kills by lions and hyenas did not detectably differ across four time periods (day, crepuscular, early night, and late night), but wild dogs and especially cheetahs concentrated on time windows that avoided nighttime hunting by lions and hyenas. Our results provide new insight into the conditions under which partitioning may not allow for coexistence for one subordinate species, the African wild dog, while it does for cheetah. Because of differences in responses to dominant competitors, African wild dogs may be more prone to competitive exclusion (local extirpation), particularly in open, uniform ecosystems with simple (often wildebeest dominated) prey communities, where spatial avoidance is difficult.",

	abstract = "The known Cheetah population is roughly 6,700 adult and adolescent animals distributed across 29 subpopulations. These estimates are very approximate, and are derived from largely expert assessment and from the extent of known resident Cheetah range multiplied by density, however, they constitute the best available information. The global population estimate can be broken down regionally into an estimated 4,190 adults in Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a, in prep.); 1,960 adults in Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); 440 adults in Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012); and 80 adults in Iran (Hunter et al. 2007, Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). There is only a single subpopulation with an estimated size of more than 1,000 individuals, and only one additional subpopulation larger than 500, the remaining 27 known subpopulations are estimated to hold less than 500 individuals. Additional areas where Cheetah status is poorly known are unlikely to raise the total to over 10,000. Generation time for a Cheetah is estimated at 4.9 years using the formula GL = Rspan*z +AFR (Pacifici et al. 2013). AFR =age at first reproduction 2 years (Durant et al. 2004); Rspan = reproductive lifespan, which is the age at last reproduction 12 years (Durant et al. 2004) - age of first reproduction 2 years = 10 years; z = 0.29, and is a constant ``depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population'' (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici et al. 2013). Three Cheetah generations are thus approximately 15 years. Because of the difficulty in estimating density for a wide ranging scarce carnivore like the Cheetah, there is little accurate information on population decline. In Africa we estimate that known resident Cheetah range today occupies 2,709,054 km2, while historic range was 25,344,648 km2 - a decline of 89\%. This decline in range is primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation; killing and capture of Cheetahs due to livestock depredation; and loss of prey (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Illegal trade is likely to have a big impact in some areas, notably the Horn of Africa (Nowell 2014). If we assume the bulk of this decline was exponential at a fixed percentage per year and started 100 years ago (at the onset of rapid anthropogenic environmental change), then this amounts to a loss of range of 2.26\% per year. This constant rate of decline results in an estimated resident range of 3,643,882 km2 in 1999, three Cheetah generations ago (15 years). This results in an estimated decline of 29\% resident range over the last three Cheetah generations. While some of unknown range and probable range may contain Cheetah, which would increase the estimated resident's range, this is unlikely to make a substantial change. If probable resident range is included with resident range (total 4,804,254 km2), this results in a 22\% decline from historical range over the last three Cheetah generations. However, it is unlikely that the rate of decline in Cheetah range has remained constant over the last 100 years. Drivers of decline, such as conflict, loss of prey, habitat change, are likely to have decreased disproportionately with range occupancy (Lindsey et al. 2011, Durant et al. 2014), resulting in a recent acceleration in range collapse. Thus, a decline of at least 30\% in abundance and extent of occurrence is strongly suspected over the last three Cheetah generations, and a decline of at least 10\% is likely over the next three generations. Subspecies in Iran (A. j. venaticus) and northwest Africa (A. j. heckii) are listed as Critically Endangered. The Cheetah is also assessed as Critically Endangered in the region of North and West Africa.

Conflict with farmers 3. Loss of prey 4. Bushmeat snares 5. High speed roads 6. Unregulated tourism 7. Hunted for skin \& cheetah cubs 8. Infrastructure development (mining, roads etc.) All these threats play some role in most Cheetah subpopulations across Africa. In Eastern, Southern and Western Africa, habitat loss and fragmentation have been identified as a primary threat (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Because Cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; as most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of Cheetahs (Durant et al. 2010b). In northern Africa and Iran a depleted wild ungulate prey base is a particular concern (Hunter et al. 2007, Durant et al. 2014, Belbachir et al. 2015). While conflict with livestock farmers due to livestock depredation, either perceived or real, is a widespread and serious problem across Cheetah range.",

Human populations have increased by 2.57 percent annually from 1994 to 2014 (UN 2014) driving a 57\% increase in the conversion of potential Leopard habitat to agricultural areas from 1975 to 2000 (Brink and Eva 2009). Deforestation in South-east Asia has increased for palm oil and rubber plantations (Sodhi et al. 2010, Miettinen et al. 2011). These factors were not incorporated in the previous assessment and likely have a substantial impact on suitable Leopard range. Comparison of the extent of extant range presented in this assessment (8,515,935 km², see map) with that produced by Red List Assessors in 2007 (21,953,435 km²: Henschel et al. 2008) yields a range reduction of 61\%. However the severity of this reduction is inaccurate due to previous insufficient sampling (the 2016 map is much more detailed in resolution, see Methodology in the Supplementary Material), and the reduction has likely occurred over a longer time scale. Though our knowledge of the Leopard distribution is better today than in 2008, it is still limited at the national, regional and range-wide scales because reliable data on Leopard population trends are missing from large portions of their range. We suspect, however, that at least half of the reduction translates to real and relatively recent range loss. Also in southern Africa, the so called stronghold of the Leopard, there is no evidence to suggest that Leopard populations have remained stable (G. Balme pers. comm. 2015). In Zimbabwe, much Leopard range has disappeared due to the resettlement of private farmland and subsequent loss of prey populations (du Toit 2004). We estimate regional range loss of approximately 21\% in southern Africa. We suspect that suitable Leopard range has been reduced by >30\% worldwide in the last three generations (22.3 years). We calculated generation length as 7.42 years (based on the formula presented in Pacifici et al. 2013 and data from wild Leopard populations presented in Balme et al. 2013). Leopard population density across the species{\rq} range is known to track the biomass of principle Leopard prey species, medium-size and large wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward et al. 2007). Prey species are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey et al. 2013). A commercialized bushmeat trade has caused an estimated 59\% average decline in Leopard prey populations across 78 protected areas in West, East and southern Africa between 1970 and 2005 (Craigie et al. 2010). Though ungulate populations have increased by 24\% in southern Africa, potential prey numbers have declined by 52\% in East Africa and 85\% in West Africa (Craigie et al. 2010). Bushmeat poaching in Mozambique (Hatton et al. 2001, Fusari et al. 2006) and Zambia (Lindsey et al. 2014) has severely reduced Leopard prey (Becker et al. 2013) inside and outside of protected areas. Many wildlife areas are suffering from substantial ungulate decline, including Zambian Game Management Areas and National Parks, maintain large mammal populations at 93.7\% and 74.1\% below estimated carrying capacity, respectively (Lindsey et al. 2014). With such reductions to Leopard prey, we infer a >50\% loss of Leopard populations across East and West Africa. Through extensive poaching pressure also in Asia many prey species, such as Sambar Deer in Malaysia, are threatened with regional extirpation throughout tropical forest systems (Corbett 2007, Kawanishi et al. 2014). In South-east and East Asia, poaching for Leopard prey and targeted Leopard hunts for the wildlife trade market are taking place. A regional survey found that Leopards in India have been poached at a rate of four individuals per week for the illegal wildlife trade (Raza et al. 2012b). Nowell and Pervushina (2012) found the illegal trade of Leopard parts was comparable to that of Tigers in Asian range States and derivative seizures with an average of 3.5 Leopards seizure cases per month in India since 2000. Preliminary data suggest that the illegal trade in Leopard skins for cultural regalia is rampant in southern Africa. It is suggested that 4,500-7,000 Leopards area harvested annually to fuel the demand for Leopards skins by followers of the Nazareth Babtist (Shembe) Church only (Balme unpub. data). Poorly managed trophy hunting adds to pressure on local Leopard populations. Balme et al. (2009) showed that trophy hunting was a key driver of Leopard population decline prior to intervention in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Similarly, Pitman et al. (2015) demonstrated that Leopards are over-harvested across much of their range in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The concern about unsustainable trophy hunting has lately increased, e.g. South Africa has banned trophy hunting for 2016. This followed an alert by its CITES Scientific Authority that the number of Leopards in the country was unknown, and that trophy hunting posed a high risk to the survival of the species. Taken all together, the Leopard meets the A2cd criterion for Vulnerable, based on loss of habitat and prey, and exploitation. These causes of the suspected reduction are not well understood, have not ceased, and are likely to continue, and future decline is anticipated unless conservation efforts are taken.

Habitat fragmentation, reduced prey base and conflict with livestock and game farming have reduced Leopard populations throughout most of their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray et al. 2005, Hunter et al. 2013). The conversion of forest habitats and savanna systems to agriculture, livestock farming and urban sprawl have significantly reduced Leopard range. Though exceptions exist (Athreya et al. 2013), this conversion typically leads to the depletion of natural prey species through poaching thereby reducing the natural prey base in these areas.",
