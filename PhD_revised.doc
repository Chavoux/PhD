\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch Predators form an important part of any ecosystem and it has been suggested that most ecosystems are actually top-down controlled (Estes et al., 2011) and therefore susceptible to trophic cascades when top-level predators are removed. It follows that an ecosystem without its full complement of predators might not be able to deliver ecosystem services sustainably, in addition to the wider loss in biodiversity. The removal of top predators leads to meso-predator release (e.g. the removal of leopards in some areas may lead to an increase in the number of caracals and black-backed jackals). Similar increase in meso-predator numbers has been shown in America for coyotes as a result of the loss of wolves, cougars or grizzly bears (Estes et al., 2011). Current conserved areas are insufficient to ensure the long-term survival of large, wide-ranging predators like leopards and cheetahs, both because of intra-guild hostility by larger, social predators like lions and spotted hyenas (Ritchie and Johnson, 2009) inside conserved areas and because of the minimum required number of individuals needed in a population to ensure genetic survival (Stuart, 1981, Lande, 1995) combined with the home range size requirements of these species. Thus it is not strange that the majority (90% - Marker et al., 2003) of surviving cheetahs in Namibia are found on farmlands outside formally conserved areas. It is therefore imperative to get buy-in from landowners outside formally conserved areas to ensure the long-term survival of these predator species.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch Globally, the greatest thread to mammal biodiversity is habitat destruction or degradation(Schipper et al., 2008). However, for cheetahs in Namibia, direct killing by humans and the resulting change in population demographics, have been identified as the greatest contributors to their mortality rates (Marker et al., 2003). A number of management techniques have been demonstrated as effective in minimising livestock losses to predation (Shumann and others, 2004), but conflict with predators because of livestock or game losses are still a common on Namibian farms. Although the spatial ecology of both leopards (Marker and Dickman, 2005) and cheetahs (Marker et al., 2008) have been extensively studied using radio-tracking, their interaction with each other, and with smaller predators on Namibian farms are less clear. The major predators perceived as a threat to their livelihoods by farmers in Northern Namibia, are leopards (Panthera pardus), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), caracals (Felis caracal) and black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas). Black-backed jackals in particular, is considered as a problem by some game farmers as well as communal farmers with large herds of goats and sheep (e.g. recent survey by CCF in four conservancies of the Greater Waterberg Complex). A better understanding of the ecological systems as it currently functions on Namibian farms, might be the key to better management and prevention of livestock losses. Some key aspects and questions that flow from previous research include:}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch 1. Spatial ecology of the various predators. What factors determine home range sizes? What factors determine the location of core areas withing home ranges? Are there preferred hunting areas within the home ranges of predators and what variables are important in the choice of "hunting areas" (if they exist)? Leopards in the Karoo side of the Cederberg Mountains made much more use of dry river beds than the mountains inside their territories, while those leopards in the Fynbos side tend to use all of their territory (Martins, 2010). Can habitat types have a similar effect on the use of their home ranges for Namibian predators? If both cheetah and leopard home ranges of females are resource-dependent whereas male home ranges are determined by the availability of females (cf. Marker, 2002 and Martins, 2010) why do leopard males generally have larger home ranges than females (Martins, 2010, Stein et al., 2011) while cheetah females have larger home ranges than males (Marker et al., 2008)?}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch 2. Diet and prey preferences. Most predator species teach their young to hunt. To what extend is there individual differences in prey preference and can a species-wide "index of prey preference" be established for each predator species? Are there other factors in addition to prey size and availability that determines prey preference? Is there any difference in prey preference between commercial, communal and conserved areas for the different predators? Is there any change in jackal diet where larger predators are present (and they can scavenge) compared to areas with few or no large predators? Linnell et al. (1999) claimed that "problem animals" do not exist and that predators probably only take prey (including livestock) according to availability (and with the obvious provisio that it is in the right size class for the predator). Is this true for all four of the Namibian predators under consideration?}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch 3. Is there any spatial interaction between the various predator species? Since leopards are known to kill and occasionally prey on all three the other predator species (cf. Bothma and Riche, 1994 with 15% of Kalahari leopard scats including black-backed jackal), does this have any spatial or behavioural effect?}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch 4. Habitat changes. How have changes in vegetation and climate influenced predator distribution? Some farmers have claimed that there has been a recent increase in the number of leopards in areas where they used to be scarce, with a simultaneous decrease in cheetah numbers (R. Ritter, F. Kok, pers. comm.). Simultaneously, an increase in numbers of cheetahs in other areas are claimed (Marker et al., 2007). What are the possible factors causing this change?}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch 5. The impact of seasonal behavioural changes. Cheetahs show seasonal peaks in their breeding in March and June, although they breed throughout the year (Marker et al., 2003). Although black-backed jackals in other areas are know to whelp from September to October (Bingham and Purchase, 2003), it is not sure if the same pattern holds in Northern Namibia. When there are young ones to feed, an increase in predation around the breeding site can be expected. They are also less likely to range as far for food during this period. By identifying probable den areas within the home range of a female predator or breeding pair, farmers can avoid having young or vulnerable livestock in those parts of his farm. It will therefore be useful to identify the factors used by the different predators species in choosing den sites.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch 6. Rangeland management and bush encroachment. Not only habitat destruction, but also habitat degradation can be considered as a threat to biodiversity. Predator species can act as "umbrella species" in the sense that a healthy population of predators can only be sustained by a healthy eco-system. By making sure that predators can survive on their land, farmers indirectly also ensure that the ecosystem remains sustainable. Any degradation in their habitat can be expected to have an influence on the behaviour and density of predators. In this sense predators can also serve as "indicator species" for a healthy -system. The role of livestock as part of the larger herbivore guild in the -system and why some game species can survive on livestock farms without any apparent effect on the "grazing capacity" of the farms, will be considered. Sinclair et al. (2003) mentioned that diverse ecosystems have a combination of top-down (for smaller herbivores) and bottom-up (for herbivores with body mass larger than 150 kg) control. Removal of predators can change this dynamic and needs to be taken into account for managing land sustainably.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch 7. Current livestock predation prevention management techniques and possible alternatives. What are the specific reasons for non-lethal methods not being used universally on Namibian farms? What options are available to game farmers in particular? What new (or old) methods exist that has not been tried in Namibia yet? How does the type of farming (commercial vs communal; cattle vs game vs small livestock vs mixed) influence the perception of predation and tolerance of predator species? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different non-lethal livestock predation prevention methods? What factors would determine whether a specific method would be the best option on a specific farm and situation?}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

The role of conservancies and the factors that determine the success of conservancies in both ecosystem conservation and predator conservation. If 22.1% of Namibian land currently belong to conservancies in addition to 16.5% formally conserved land (Davis et al., 2011), why does it not seem as if human-wildlife conflict is decreasing? If conservancies is the answer to the conservation of cheetahs (and other predators - Lindsey et al., 2013), how much of the total Namibian farmland should be part of a conservancy before it will prevent human-wildlife conflict? The answer might be not more conservancies, but better functioning conservancies. What role does current conservancies actually play in biodiversity conservation and specifically the continued survival of near-threatened (leopard, brown hyena) and vulnerable (cheetah) predator species? Does belonging to a conservancy have any influence on the amount of bush encroachment on a farm? What tools are currently used for rangeland management on conservancies? If carrying capacity is not a good veld management tool, what are the alternatives to ensure a healthy, sustainable and productive ecosystem?}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch (a) It is frequently claimed that there has been an increase in bush encroachment in Namibia. It can be assumed that this will have an effect both on the available grazing for livestock, and on the species composition of natural herbivores, with a change to more browsers and less grazers. This change in herbivore species (and spatial behaviour) can be expected to also cause a change in predator species. It is hypothesised that a shift in predator species composition (as well as relative prey species abundance) will be seen vs the null hypothesis of no change in relative predator species abundance.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch (b) A major cause of human-wildlife conflict, especially in many communal areas, is the lack of alternative prey (wildlife) for predators. Both hunting and over-grazing or bad veld management practices contributes to this lack in herbivore biodiversity. While McGranahan (2008) favours the use of fire to prevent bush encroachment (citing the differences between Zambian and Namibian game farm management in this regard), the Savory institute favours "holistic management" where livestock mimic large herds of natural herbivores (http://www.savoryinstitute.com) and short grazing periods to prevent desertification and bush encroachment. In the Herero land communal area, part of the Greater Waterberg Complex of conservancies, the effects of veld degradation is easily visible even to the naked eye. Habitat rehabilitation will be needed for restoring the eco-system, before alternative methods to protect livestock can be applied for long-term sustainability. These two approaches will be compared both in terms of ecological theory and practical effectiveness for restoring ecological interactions, biodiversity and eco-system services. The effect of two methods will be compared to a control area with no change in management and an area using the carrying capacity idea for veld management.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch (a) Once good capture sites have been identified, adult predators of all four species will be captured using a combination of cage traps (for cheetahs, caracals and possibly leopards), soft traps (Kamler et al., 2008) and foot snares (Frank et al., 2003) for jackals and leopards.

In the former case, simply taking better care of the livestock should be enough to protect livestock and the predator can stay where it should be. In addition, the myth of the "problem animal" (an individual who prefers livestock to natural prey) can be dispelled. However, if there are clear individual differences in prey preferences, it is more likely that individual habitual livestock hunters exist in the specific species. In that case, it might perhaps be better to remove the animal and to relocate it to a fenced conservation area with no livestock available (or hunt it if it can no longer hunt natural prey because of old age). If it can be shown that prey preferences differ individually, management can deal with individuals, rather than causing the indiscriminate removal of all individuals of the guilty species.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

If there is strong preferences for certain species (and not just size classes), it might help game farmers with high-value game species to stock their land with lower-valued, but preferred prey species. On the other hand, if there is only a weak preferences for specific species, this will have little/no effect. And because of species differences, this method might work for one predator species, but not for another, making the question on habitat preferences more relevant.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

Previous research has shown already that there is extensive overlap between cheetah and leopard home ranges in Namibia (Marker, 2002). Does this mean that we should not expect any change in cheetah spatial behaviour in the absence of leopards or spatial changes in leopards if cheetahs were exterminated from their territories? Such behavioural changes might include changes in diet and hunting range.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

If leopards keep away caracals and jackals, (and lambs/kids normally being too small to be preferred leopard prey), small livestock farmers might not need to keep lambs in the kraal in an area with leopards, but rather concentrate on methods to protect the adult livestock. Moreover, this might be an additional ecological role of larger predators, motivating farmers to keep a large predator around if it is not killing livestock.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

If a shift in predator species composition is found and it can be correlated to habitat changes (or other factors), it means that by managing the habitat (or other factors influencing predator movement) the predator species distribution can also be managed. Since predators are part of the whole eco-system, any changes in habitat or prey species composition could have unforeseen results for predators which needs to be taken into account if we want to conserve them into the future. The importance of habitat destruction as the major driver of extinctions will be important here.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\itap0{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch Two of the four predator species with a significant impact on livestock (and game) farming, are classified as vulnerable (Acinonyx jubatus) and near-threatened (Panthera pardus) by the IUCN (Schipper et al., 2008). Even though Namibia remains the global stronghold for free-roaming cheetahs, the survival of Namibian cheetahs are by no means secure. Because of their large home ranges and competition from larger social predators, formally conserved areas are not enough to ensure their survival. It is therefore imperative that practical solutions to human-predator conflict on Namibian farmlands be found. This project will make great strides in finding new solutions and applying existing solutions to human-wildlife conflict in Namibia in order for livestock farmers to farm with predators instead of fighting against nature.}{\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
